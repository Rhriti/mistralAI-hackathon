90.39 : even though the guest machine started up    88.799 - 92.31 : in the file that was being viewed on the    90.39 - 93.57000000000001 : host machine over here I can actually    92.31 - 95.22 : browse through pretty much any file in    93.57 - 96.72 : the workspace so I can go and browse    95.22 - 99.329 : over into the debug folder if I wanted    96.72 - 100.71 : to go open up other folders over here my    99.329 - 102.75 : intellisense and those type of things    100.71 - 105.24 : those all just work even though I'm in 8    102.75 - 106.71 : this is not this workspace is not    105.24 - 109.28999999999999 : actually hosted in my local machine it    106.71 - 111.0 : is all coming from this remote 4 machine    109.29 - 112.68 : over here so I get all those features    111.0 - 114.689 : even though I am in this guest session    112.68 - 116.04 : so that's a quick look at the live share    114.689 - 117.57 : extension there's a ton about the    116.04 - 119.67 : functionality it has you can set up    117.57 - 122.189 : shared terminals for example to share    119.67 - 124.14 : debugging even share websites that you    122.189 - 126.0 : host in the S code or that you start    124.14 - 128.31 : from BS code you can share those between    126.0 - 130.11 : the guest machine and the host machine    128.31 - 131.73 : as well I find that live share is    130.11 - 133.34900000000002 : especially helpful when you're wanting    131.73 - 133.63 : to quickly walk through a problem or if    133.349 - 135.31 : we think    133.63 - 137.29 : like remote interviews and not with so    135.31 - 139.21 : many teams being distributed and so many    137.29 - 142.04999999999998 : people working from home live share can    139.21 - 142.05 : be really invaluable "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Software usage starts at 0:00 and ends at 0:15"}]}

18.81 : if you struggled with understanding how    12.509 - 21.39 : git rebase works keep watching now let's    18.81 - 24.18 : have a look at git rebase that you    21.39 - 27.810000000000002 : probably have heard a lot about but you    24.18 - 29.369 : probably scared to use at all ok so some    27.81 - 32.94 : people say git rebase is very dangerous    29.369 - 34.739 : don't use it and some people are using    32.94 - 37.53 : it without any headaches so in this    34.739 - 40.5 : video we will try to explain how git    37.53 - 42.75 : rebase works and then you know when to    40.5 - 45.329 : use it and when to stay away from it    42.75 - 47.879 : ok so you will definitely know that git    45.329 - 51.03 : rebase and git merge are very similar    47.879 - 53.94 : they help you to bring changes from    51.03 - 56.07 : another branch into yours ok so this is    53.94 - 58.079 : the graph that you've seen in the git    56.07 - 61.829 : merge video so if you haven't seen it go    58.079 - 64.08 : check it out and we are making a merge    61.829 - 66.78 : commit when we try to bring in his    64.08 - 68.97 : changes to my branch ok so this is the    66.78 - 72.71000000000001 : merge commit and then we can keep    68.97 - 72.71 : working on our feature branch    75.01 - 82.9 : now let's do the git rebase okay so this    79.36 - 85.0 : is the point that I'm at in vs code when    82.9 - 88.54 : we switch to the code this is the point    85.0 - 90.76 : we have three commits in my branch ABC    88.54 - 94.60000000000001 : and then we have two comets in his    90.76 - 99.07000000000001 : branch a a and B B now let's have a look    94.6 - 105.53999999999999 : at the get lock we have ABC comets on my    99.07 - 109.24 : branch and if we check out his branch    105.54 - 111.7 : you'll see that the lock shows the a B    109.24 - 115.99 : commits at that point we've created the    111.7 - 118.84 : branch and we have the KNVB commit okay    115.99 - 121.44999999999999 : if you can see I'm also typing just get    118.84 - 124.12 : ello not get lock and the one line    121.45 - 126.13 : that's the alias of setup so if you    124.12 - 128.41 : don't know how to setup get Aaliyah's    126.13 - 131.14 : check out some of the git config videos    128.41 - 134.47 : in this playlist in the get tutorials    131.14 - 140.52999999999997 : playlist now we'll check out again my    134.47 - 143.41 : branch and we'll do the rebase git    140.53 - 147.79 : rebase this branch will take his changes    143.41 - 151.45 : and put my changes aside apply his    147.79 - 153.94 : changes and then one commit by one will    151.45 - 155.35 : try to reapply my changes okay so we'll    153.94 - 157.51 : show it a little bit later in the    155.35 - 160.15 : presentation but for now that's what's    157.51 - 163.959 : gonna happen and I will also add the    160.15 - 165.97 : flag I for interactive so you see what's    163.959 - 168.13 : happening okay if I didn't include the I    165.97 - 171.1 : it would just happen and we would just    168.13 - 173.32 : see the outcome like with merge but if    171.1 - 176.14 : we add the I maybe it will give you a    173.32 - 178.93 : little bit more hint of what's happening    176.14 - 182.67999999999998 : behind the scenes so git rebase I for    178.93 - 186.73000000000002 : interactive his branch and now we have    182.68 - 189.19 : the comets being replayed on his branch    186.73 - 192.97 : soda as I said might change my commits    189.19 - 195.88 : the cecum it was put aside his changes    192.97 - 199.09 : were brought in and now my changes are    195.88 - 201.54999999999998 : one commit by one being replayed over    199.09 - 204.04 : his changes and here we have an option    201.55 - 206.079 : to either pick some of these comments at    204.04 - 208.23999999999998 : the moment we have only did one but you    206.079 - 211.09 : would see a list of comets    208.24 - 214.06 : over here that you can interact with    211.09 - 216.52 : okay and you can change the way they    214.06 - 218.68 : will be dealt with so first one is pick    216.52 - 220.87 : that's the default value so if we didn't    218.68 - 222.61 : change anything all the comments would    220.87 - 226.9 : be picked and they would be replayed    222.61 - 229.63000000000002 : over his changes will type in : and cue    226.9 - 232.15 : to quit and that's it now we've    229.63 - 235.26999999999998 : successfully rebased our branch and    232.15 - 238.09 : brought in his changes and as you can    235.27 - 239.8 : see in the resulting rebase text file    238.09 - 241.84 : okay so we've got all three comments    239.8 - 244.69 : from my branch two commits from his    241.84 - 246.34 : branch and that's it we had no marriage    244.69 - 248.98 : conflict because obviously I've got    246.34 - 251.5 : simple changes and I didn't want to    248.98 - 253.72 : confuse you with merge conflicts but as    251.5 - 256.989 : long as you understand how the rebase    253.72 - 259.57 : works then you know that the resolving    256.989 - 262.71999999999997 : conflicts is exactly the same in rebase    259.57 - 265.24 : than in git merge okay so let's go back    262.72 - 267.13000000000005 : to the presentation and now let's have a    265.24 - 269.89 : look at again visually on what's    267.13 - 273.07 : happened in vs code we run the git    269.89 - 277.12 : rebase his branch that would put my    273.07 - 280.54 : changes aside bring in his changes and    277.12 - 283.3 : then reapply the comments that we pick    280.54 - 286.3 : at the moment we picked only the one on    283.3 - 290.91 : to my branch okay so this will be the    286.3 - 294.01 : resulting line of comments and we are    290.91 - 297.28000000000003 : creating new commits for the changes we    294.01 - 300.13 : reapplying okay so the hash the ID of    297.28 - 301.80999999999995 : this commit would change and that's    300.13 - 305.44 : exactly the dangerous part about    301.81 - 308.17 : rebasing because the new changes are    305.44 - 310.71999999999997 : rewriting the history so if someone else    308.17 - 313.3 : would checked out your branch or    310.72 - 316.69000000000005 : branched out of your branch before you    313.3 - 319.81 : rebase yours then it would be really    316.69 - 322.62 : hard to figure out what the history of    319.81 - 325.12 : each branch is just to summarise we    322.62 - 328.15 : replayed the comments on top of the new    325.12 - 331.6 : base which in our case was his branch    328.15 - 334.0 : and rebase rewrites the history by    331.6 - 336.70000000000005 : creating new comets okay so this is the    334.0 - 339.22 : important part of our rebasing once you    336.7 - 340.94 : rebase the comments that it tries to    339.22 - 343.25 : reapply    340.94 - 345.41 : our new comments with the same changes    343.25 - 349.1 : but new IDs and that creates the    345.41 - 351.68 : headache and it keeps the get history    349.1 - 354.05 : clean so the the line of comments it's    351.68 - 356.75 : much cleaner than if you using git merge    354.05 - 362.27000000000004 : so if your team prefers cleaner history    356.75 - 365.63 : then rebase is the way to go some points    362.27 - 367.82 : of and when to use rebase and when not I    365.63 - 370.49 : think it's very safe to rebase your own    367.82 - 373.04 : local branches that no one else checked    370.49 - 374.81 : out no one else is working on it's only    373.04 - 377.0 : yourself trying to bring in other    374.81 - 379.76 : changes into your brain so rebasing in    377.0 - 383.24 : that case is safe but don't rebase    379.76 - 386.45 : public branches like master you can also    383.24 - 390.26 : undo git rebase using git ref lock and    386.45 - 392.3 : git reset that I'll try to cover in next    390.26 - 394.06 : videos let me know in the comments if    392.3 - 396.47 : that's something you would like to see    394.06 - 399.35 : so hopefully that makes no more sense    396.47 - 402.02000000000004 : and you're more comfortable to rebasing    399.35 - 404.90000000000003 : your own branches and I went back to es    402.02 - 407.83 : code edit two more comments D and E and    404.9 - 411.08 : we'll try to do the git rebase again and    407.83 - 413.84 : we should see multiple comments being    411.08 - 417.5 : reapplied okay so we have a look at the    413.84 - 420.56 : log applying see applying D and applying    417.5 - 423.65 : e so this is the this is the message    420.56 - 425.66 : from the git log what's happening behind    423.65 - 427.78999999999996 : the scenes and I think it's very    425.66 - 429.95000000000005 : important that you understand now what's    427.79 - 432.8 : happening that all three comments were    429.95 - 435.65 : put aside and then one by one they were    432.8 - 439.43 : reapplied on the changes from his branch    435.65 - 442.03999999999996 : I hope that git rebase is now a much    439.43 - 444.02 : more clearer to you than seven minutes    442.04 - 446.45000000000005 : ago okay if you've listened to this    444.02 - 449.06 : video on a double speed then probably    446.45 - 451.64 : shorter but hopefully you've enjoyed    449.06 - 453.59 : this video and if you did let me know in    451.64 - 456.11 : the comments what else would you want me    453.59 - 457.78999999999996 : to cover in the next videos and don't    456.11 - 460.01 : forget to smash the like button or    457.79 - 462.71000000000004 : subscribe to the channel for more videos    460.01 -

161.70000000000002 : compiled successfully you can now view    157.8 - 164.70000000000002 : react demo in the browser so    161.7 - 167.459 : a browser is going to automatically    164.7 - 170.51899999999998 : going to open which will be your default    167.459 - 175.2 : browser and you will be able to see this    170.519 - 178.019 : kind of output right if this browser    175.2 - 179.66 : doesn't open automatically you can    178.019 - 186.0 : always    179.66 - 189.35999999999999 : copy this URL and then you can just open    186.0 - 192.06 : this in your browser so I can just copy    189.36 - 194.519 : this URL and open this in the browser    192.06 - 197.099 : and it's going to show me the same    194.519 - 200.459 : result for my react app    197.099 - 203.22 : so this is how you can open the react    200.459 - 205.14000000000001 : app in your Visual Studio code editor    203.22 - 206.7 : and run it I hope you've enjoyed this    205.14 -

6.45 : hi welcome back so in this video I will    4.41 - 10.05 : show you how to install Visual Studio    6.45 - 13.71 : code one of the popular code editor    10.05 - 16.65 : software available in the market so you    13.71 - 20.07 : can also install any other editors but    16.65 - 23.07 : this is from Microsoft and it is free to    20.07 - 27.269 : download then I will show you how to    23.07 - 30.359 : install node and NPM and PM stands for    27.269 - 34.5 : node package manager so angular    30.359 - 37.410000000000004 : framework is built on node.js and we    34.5 - 41.7 : need NPM to install different packages    37.41 - 44.16 : during our development so I'll show you    41.7 - 45.899 : how to install and configure node in a    44.16 - 48.36 : newer computer    45.899 - 52.230000000000004 : next I will be showing how to install    48.36 - 55.019999999999996 : angular CLI in the node terminal using    52.23 - 58.82899999999999 : node terminal inside Visual Studio code    55.02 - 63.539 : so then we will create a first angular    58.829 - 66.84 : app which is a basic app then finally    63.539 - 70.65 : it's important always to create a backup    66.84 - 74.49000000000001 : and if it is a huge project we need    70.65 - 77.22 : version controlling and source code    74.49 - 81.36 : management software's one of the popular    77.22 - 83.07 : of among it is github nowadays and I    81.36 - 86.22 : will show you how to create a basic    83.07 - 90.67999999999999 : repository in this video and further    86.22 - 93.84 : moving on I will show you in-depth    90.68 - 95.759 : concepts of github so in this video I    93.84 - 100.549 : will show you how to create a basic    95.759 - 100.549 : repository in github using git techstop    101.329 - 107.25 : let's see how to install Visual Studio    103.77 - 108.44999999999999 : code so go to this link this link will    107.25 - 111.03 : be in the description below    108.45 - 113.369 : inside this link you can find different    111.03 - 117.0 : version of software according to your    113.369 - 118.82 : computer for Windows download 64 or    117.0 - 121.68 : 32-bit accordingly    118.82 - 125.46 : once you download and install the Visual    121.68 - 128.12900000000002 : Studio code you can open and see    125.46 - 131.4 : something like this so moving on we will    128.129 - 134.91 : install a node and NPM    131.4 - 137.55 : to download node.js simply follow the    134.91 - 139.26 : link in the description so in this page    137.55 - 142.26000000000002 : you can see there are two versions of    139.26 - 144.89999999999998 : node.js one is NTS which is long-term    142.26 - 148.98 : supported version and one is current    144.9 - 152.16 : release version so it is recommended for    148.98 - 155.57999999999998 : most users to download LTS because it is    152.16 - 157.95 : a stable version of node.js so by    155.58 - 160.769 : clicking it install the download you    157.95 - 163.47 : know Jas and I have already done it so    160.769 - 166.44 : during installation you can see the    163.47 - 170.73 : node.js is installed in this no J's    166.44 - 174.39 : folder in Program Files so in the next    170.73 - 178.2 : step you can see the NPM package manager    174.39 - 181.29 : is also a part of this installation so    178.2 - 184.04899999999998 : simply install by clicking next so I    181.29 - 188.31 : have already downloaded and installed    184.049 - 192.33 : node.js in my machine so I will simply    188.31 - 194.64000000000001 : cancel this installation and one more    192.33 - 196.769 : thing you need to make sure after the    194.64 - 200.07 : download so go to the environment    196.769 - 205.26 : variables in your system and there will    200.07 - 207.989 : be a variable path so it will be    205.26 - 209.66 : automatically done by the Installer but    207.989 - 213.359 : to make sure you have to check it    209.66 - 215.569 : otherwise no terminal will not work so    213.359 - 223.81900000000002 : you can see here there is a path    215.569 - 226.88899999999998 : specified for the NPM that is C    223.819 - 231.03 : administrate uses administrator app data    226.889 - 234.079 : roaming and then nvm there there should    231.03 - 241.069 : be one more path in the system variables    234.079 - 244.35000000000002 : there you must see the path for nodejs    241.069 - 248.1 : specified so these two should be there    244.35 - 251.28 : in the environment variables and make    248.1 - 255.9 : sure it is there so after this you can    251.28 - 261.239 : run node.js in the terminal of Visual    255.9 - 265.26 : Studio code and install angular CLI to    261.239 - 268.26 : install angular CLI open the visuals to    265.26 - 275.49 : your court and you can see the terminal    268.26 - 284.84999999999997 : here and click new terminal so in the    275.49 - 288.15000000000003 : terminal type NPM install - G this G    284.85 - 293.13 : represents that angular CLI will be    288.15 - 299.90999999999997 : installed globally then type that    293.13 - 303.0 : angular CLI at latest I am writing this    299.91 - 308.28000000000003 : latest so that the latest version of the    303.0 - 311.19 : angular CLI will get installed hit enter    308.28 - 317.58 : and wait for the terminal to install    311.19 - 321.09 : angular CLI in your system so once the    317.58 - 324.39 : CLI is installed in the computer you can    321.09 - 328.34999999999997 : see here that it has added 84 packages    324.39 - 331.14 : and few other information so angular CLI    328.35 - 334.41 : CLI basically means comma command line    331.14 - 338.03999999999996 : interface which gives various commands    334.41 - 342.09000000000003 : to manipulate angular code in the in    338.04 - 345.27000000000004 : your system so now you can use various    342.09 - 348.17999999999995 : angular commands to create projects and    345.27 - 352.14 : create and manipulate it so now I am    348.18 - 355.59000000000003 : going to create an angular project using    352.14 - 359.43 : angular CLI so for that type this    355.59 - 365.25 : command in the angular CLI terminal ng    359.43 - 369.77 : new and the project name so I'll give    365.25 - 369.77 : the name to the project as first app    377.849 - 384.96999999999997 : when you hit Enter typing this command    382.11 - 388.389 : the terminal will ask you few questions    384.97 - 390.94000000000005 : so the first question will be like would    388.389 - 395.889 : you like to add angular routing it is    390.94 - 398.949 : always yes here I will explain what is    395.889 - 401.53000000000003 : routing later later in the end of course    398.949 - 403.41900000000004 : so the next question will be with style    401.53 - 405.58 : sheet format would you like to use so    403.419 - 413.71 : I'll be using CSS you can select with    405.58 - 416.409 : various stylesheet formats so now you    413.71 - 425.4 : can see that angular is creating its    416.409 - 430.21 : first project so once the project is    425.4 - 435.60999999999996 : created and initialized you can just    430.21 - 441.63899999999995 : open it so here you can see the project    435.61 - 444.46000000000004 : is installed in C uses administrator by    441.639 - 449.58 : the name first app so to open it simply    444.46 - 449.58 : go to file then open folder    456.43 - 472.28000000000003 : here you can go to see and users    467.83 - 476.71999999999997 : demonstrator then you can here see there    472.28 - 482.38899999999995 : is a folder called first app simply open    476.72 - 487.52000000000004 : the folder so here you can see the first    482.389 - 490.25 : angular app created by angular CLI so    487.52 - 493.37 : you can just ignore this e to e folder    490.25 - 497.379 : this is for end-to-end testing and these    493.37 - 500.27 : are the node modules we installed using    497.379 - 503.97900000000004 : angular CLI so only thing we have to    500.27 - 509.0 : care about is the source folder inside    503.979 - 513.56 : there is a folder called app and there    509.0 - 519.38 : is a component or TS file by the name a    513.56 - 522.459 : p-- so we can just compile this again    519.38 - 522.459 : using the terminal    533.07 - 542.2 : here you can just type ng sir so this    538.87 - 544.75 : project will be compiled so initially we    542.2 - 546.73 : have only one component angular is made    544.75 - 552.31 : up of components I will be explaining in    546.73 - 557.34 : later courses so this compound has an    552.31 - 561.31 : HTML file where you can see there is a    557.34 - 566.89 : h1 tag which says welcome to title and    561.31 - 569.14 : this title is string interpolated I will    566.89 - 572.65 : explain this term also string    569.14 - 577.5699999999999 : interpolation and the same component app    572.65 - 579.55 : component have a variable name title so    577.57 - 583.7800000000001 : this is initial ID initialized with    579.55 - 587.68 : first app string so when we serve this    583.78 - 590.47 : when we compile this we can open and we    587.68 - 595.87 : can in real real time see the compiled a    590.47 - 600.51 : compiled code in most for 2 0 0 port so    595.87 - 604.5 : I'll be showing you the first compiled    600.51 - 604.5 : project in Chrome now    606.0 - 612.46 : so once the angular serves this project    609.07 - 615.0600000000001 : you can see here that it is saying that    612.46 - 620.77 : you can open the browser at localhost    615.06 - 623.5 : for 200 where you can see this project    620.77 - 630.04 : in real time so I'll just open the    623.5 - 637.51 : Chrome browser and paste this link and    630.04 - 640.51 : hit enter so here you can see this is    637.51 - 643.6899999999999 : the code which is already written in the    640.51 - 648.4 : project this comes by default so this is    643.69 - 651.1 : what it was written in HTML file you can    648.4 - 653.61 : see here that if I change this title    651.1 - 653.61 : variable    656.42 - 664.8499999999999 : and save it once you save it it it    661.65 - 672.18 : recompiles again automatically and    664.85 - 674.64 : serves it on the browser now it has been    672.18 - 682.16 : compiled successfully now if you go and    674.64 - 682.16 : see here that it is showing our string    684.59 - 691.26 : now we have created our first app so    687.72 - 695.07 : let's put this project in github github    691.26 - 699.03 : is a cloud-based version control and    695.07 - 700.98 : source code management website so to put    699.03 - 703.68 : your project in github you need an    700.98 - 706.29 : account I have already created an    703.68 - 708.15 : account and I have logged in so here you    706.29 - 711.48 : can see I have all these repositories    708.15 - 714.6899999999999 : already so there are two ways to put    711.48 - 718.74 : your project into github cloud so one is    714.69 - 721.59 : git bash it is a way where you you type    718.74 - 724.8 : commands from the terminal and you put    721.59 - 727.14 : the code it is not that convenient at    724.8 - 731.0699999999999 : this point of time so there is another    727.14 - 734.13 : way get Dex github desktop so you can    731.07 - 736.95 : download the software in this link so    734.13 - 739.65 : this is in the description below so    736.95 - 745.2900000000001 : after downloading just open the github    739.65 - 748.41 : desktop you can see this screen so first    745.29 - 750.9 : thing you have to do is go to file click    748.41 - 754.41 : options here you can see there is a    750.9 - 756.75 : sign-in option so sign in with the same    754.41 - 761.75 : account which you created with github    756.75 - 761.75 : calm so I will let just log in now    775.55 - 783.39 : so now if we if we want to add our    779.93 - 787.4699999999999 : project into the new repository you can    783.39 - 794.87 : select add local repository and choose    787.47 - 798.6 : the path here our app is in first app    794.87 - 799.44 : folder select the folder and add    798.6 - 803.7 : repository    799.44 - 806.5200000000001 : once you select add repository locally    803.7 - 810.09 : your repository is created and you can    806.52 - 814.1999999999999 : see here changes so it is changing it is    810.09 - 816.72 : saying that you have changed a line of    814.2 - 818.6700000000001 : code here it is also showing that you    816.72 - 823.49 : have changed title is equal to first app    818.67 - 831.24 : into another string that we have done so    823.49 - 835.05 : what we have to do now is we every time    831.24 - 838.59 : when you want to push the changes to    835.05 - 844.4699999999999 : online cloud you need to give a comment    838.59 - 850.97 : here so I will give adding first code    844.47 - 850.97 : change then I can commit to the master    851.81 - 859.53 : so so now the code has been committed to    855.54 - 863.01 : the master master branch but it is still    859.53 - 867.74 : not in the online or cloud you can see I    863.01 - 872.49 : will if i refresh here there is no new    867.74 - 874.47 : repository is listed here so what have    872.49 - 877.89 : to do now is I have to publish    874.47 - 881.45 : repository to github so there is a logic    877.89 - 883.83 : behind why we do this why there is a    881.45 - 886.32 : two-step process    883.83 - 888.83 : what is committing to master I will put    886.32 - 891.9000000000001 : all these things in in a separate video    888.83 - 895.38 : soon so now what we have to do is    891.9 - 898.67 : publish repository with the name a first    895.38 - 898.67 : app the same name    899.97 - 906.97 : okay we can we cannot add this privately    904.089 - 910.33 : because you need to upgrade your data    906.97 - 913.6 : boxes so this repository all the    910.33 - 916.12 : repositories initially we will be public    913.6 - 918.49 : so you can also go into my repository    916.12 - 922.3 : and see my codes I will also put the    918.49 - 925.48 : github repositories link in the    922.3 - 927.88 : description you can little little small    925.48 - 930.85 : small projects on angular in my github    927.88 - 933.22 : account so they should not be private at    930.85 - 948.0 : this point of time you can click publish    933.22 - 948.0 : repository you can see the progress here    954.209 - 964.18 : now it is done so if I now go and    958.8 - 967.7199999999999 : refresh the online website you can see    964.18 - 972.8199999999999 : here there is a repository added if I go    967.72 - 977.14 : inside you can see the code whatever we    972.82 - 979.86 : had written here is stored here so it is    977.14 - 982.54 : a good practice every time when you    979.86 - 986.95 : finalize your code you push it to the    982.54 - 989.98 : github repository so that it is kind of    986.95 - 991.87 : backup and in a huge project there are    989.98 - 994.12 : there will be creating versions of    991.87 - 996.13 : software's they will test the first    994.12 - 998.11 : version then move it to the master there    996.13 - 1000.63 : are different branches here I can create    998.11 - 1005.279 : different branches so I will teach all    1000.63 - 1008.04 : this in upcoming videos so thank you for    1005.279 - 1010.949 : watching and if you get any doubts    1008.04 - 1014.13 : please put it in the comments so I'll be    1010.949 - 1015.329 : helping you as soon as possible thank    1014.13 - 1019.56 : you for watching and please subscribe    1015.329 - 1022.9799999999999 : for upcoming tutorial videos on angular    1019.56 - 1025.85 : we will start with all the basics and    1022.98 - 1029.85 : we'll create as a separate project    1025.85 - 1030.99 : tutorial project in this series of    1029.85 - 1033.62 : tutorials    1030.99 - 1033.6200000000001 : thank you once again "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Software usage starts at 4:15 and ends at 11:00"}]}

14.08 : so today i'm gonna talk about    12.16 - 15.280000000000001 : one of my favorite features in visual    14.08 - 17.279 : studio code    15.28 - 18.8 : probably the only thing that keeps    17.279 - 19.359 : bringing me back to this editor even    18.8 - 21.76 : though my    19.359 - 23.840000000000003 : default editor is emacs and that is the    21.76 - 24.32 : python interactive mode in visual studio    23.84 - 26.64 : code    24.32 - 28.0 : now before we talk about the python    26.64 - 29.439 : interactive mode itself    28.0 - 31.439 : i want to take a moment to talk about    29.439 - 33.92 : the fact that visual studio code    31.439 - 35.76 : will actually open ipython notebooks    33.92 - 37.04 : just natively this is a relatively    35.76 - 37.839999999999996 : recent feature i think one year or    37.04 - 39.839999999999996 : something like that    37.84 - 42.239000000000004 : and to do that we can just do like open    39.84 - 42.239000000000004 : a file    43.44 - 46.399 : and then i have this running code    44.8 - 47.919999999999995 : example notebook that i got from the    46.399 - 49.36 : internet if i just click on that    47.92 - 50.879000000000005 : it's going to do a few things first    49.36 - 51.6 : you're going to see the json and then    50.879 - 53.36 : it's going to run    51.6 - 55.36 : the notebook and what it's doing    53.36 - 56.239 : actually is in the background it is    55.36 - 58.559 : running    56.239 - 60.16 : a jupyter server and then it is using    58.559 - 61.76 : that to serve this notebook    60.16 - 63.279999999999994 : effectively the same way that a browser    61.76 - 65.28 : might and then if you wanted your work    63.28 - 67.68 : to be inside a particular python    65.28 - 69.119 : virtual environment you actually get the    67.68 - 70.56 : ability to select the virtual    69.119 - 71.28 : environments similar to how you might be    70.56 - 73.68 : doing it in    71.28 - 74.72 : a normal python workflow in vs code note    73.68 - 76.64 : that to get to this point    74.72 - 78.88 : all i had to do was install the official    76.64 - 80.56 : python extension vs code handles    78.88 - 82.96 : basically everything else now you can    80.56 - 85.119 : see vs code shows me all the available    82.96 - 86.55999999999999 : global python environments and then i    85.119 - 87.36 : also made a virtual environment called    86.56 - 88.88 : test and    87.36 - 90.479 : that option is there as well this    88.88 - 92.79899999999999 : notebook functions    90.479 - 93.759 : almost exactly like a normal notebook so    92.799 - 95.43900000000001 : if i just hit    93.759 - 97.36 : shift enter on a cell it'll run that    95.439 - 99.119 : cell or render markdown    97.36 - 101.6 : i can run this cell and then the value    99.119 - 104.72 : of a will be set to 10    101.6 - 106.479 : printouts show up as you expect    104.72 - 108.96 : and yeah it works just like a normal    106.479 - 109.92 : notebook now i love notebooks for    108.96 - 112.24 : prototyping    109.92 - 113.04 : and i use them or used to use them all    112.24 - 114.15899999999999 : the time    113.04 - 116.159 : but this feature that i'm going to talk    114.159 - 118.32000000000001 : about the python interactive mode    116.159 - 120.24000000000001 : has completely removed notebooks from my    118.32 - 123.19999999999999 : workflow    120.24 - 124.0 : so if i go ahead and open a new file and    123.2 - 128.08 : just save that    124.0 - 130.479 : as a python file    128.08 - 132.0 : this is a standard python file right now    130.479 - 134.31900000000002 : there's not going to be anything special    132.0 - 136.0 : about it until    134.319 - 138.56 : i make this special comment and all of a    136.0 - 140.72 : sudden vs code gives me these options    138.56 - 142.72 : i can run this cell i can run this cell    140.72 - 143.44 : and run the cells below or i can debug    142.72 - 146.0 : the cell    143.44 - 147.84 : this looks an awful lot like a notebook    146.0 - 150.56 : so if i go ahead and write let's say    147.84 - 150.56 : import os    150.959 - 154.959 : i did a control enter there which is    152.64 - 157.599 : standard notebook shortcut for    154.959 - 159.2 : running the cell but not advancing and    157.599 - 160.959 : what vs code does now    159.2 - 162.39999999999998 : is that it throws up this interactive    160.959 - 164.48 : window on the right    162.4 - 165.59900000000002 : and then in that window it actually ran    164.48 - 167.2 : the command    165.599 - 168.959 : that was in that cell i can go back to    167.2 - 171.51899999999998 : the cell and let's say    168.959 - 172.72 : do shift enter and it'll run that    171.519 - 174.08 : command again    172.72 - 175.92 : it'll show me what that command is and    174.08 - 177.68 : if if it has any output    175.92 - 179.04 : we will see the output as well and then    177.68 - 180.31900000000002 : there's also this icon that you can    179.04 - 182.56 : click to go to the code    180.319 - 184.56 : the the particular cell that generated    182.56 - 186.72 : that output so you can sort of keep    184.56 - 188.0 : these two pieces the code on the left    186.72 - 190.8 : and the output on the right    188.0 - 192.48 : in sync to some degree now if i were to    190.8 - 193.12 : write a command that produces an output    192.48 - 196.23899999999998 : for example    193.12 - 196.239 : os.list tires    196.56 - 200.72 : that output gets printed on the right as    198.159 - 203.76 : well this thing on the right    200.72 - 205.12 : it's like a normal ipython shell    203.76 - 206.319 : on the bottom i actually get a prompt    205.12 - 207.76 : and it says you know you can type code    206.319 - 210.83999999999997 : here and press shift enter to run    207.76 - 212.64 : very similar to writing something in a    210.84 - 216.31900000000002 : cell so great    212.64 - 218.64 : we have a very basic text file    216.319 - 220.72 : just a normal.pi file but we can    218.64 - 222.48 : interact with it we can separate it out    220.72 - 224.319 : in the same way as a notebook    222.48 - 226.56 : this is amazing to me and i hope you're    224.319 - 227.2 : excited as well now i'm pretty bad when    226.56 - 230.159 : it comes to    227.2 - 231.76 : abusing ipython magics and one of the    230.159 - 233.84 : cool things that this mode does is that    231.76 - 237.04 : you can actually keep those magic so    233.84 - 239.12 : the one unholy line that no one should    237.04 - 243.12 : ever ever run but we all run anyway    239.12 - 244.72 : pylab inline you can just run that    243.12 - 246.64000000000001 : oh and i get an error when i try to do    244.72 - 247.92 : that because i was not in the right    246.64 - 249.439 : virtual environment    247.92 - 251.439 : you can switch the virtual environment    249.439 - 252.4 : by clicking on this button on the lower    251.439 - 253.92 : left    252.4 - 255.59900000000002 : if i click on that it gives me the same    253.92 - 257.12 : options that i was showing before i want    255.599 - 258.71999999999997 : the test virtual environment because i    257.12 - 259.759 : have matplotlib installed in that so i    258.72 - 261.12 : click that    259.759 - 264.08000000000004 : and actually before we can run the cell    261.12 - 265.919 : again we have to restart    264.08 - 267.75899999999996 : the ipython kernel because we changed    265.919 - 269.919 : our virtual environment    267.759 - 271.759 : so we do that it says all variables will    269.919 - 274.08 : be lost i usually set that to yes and    271.759 - 276.639 : don't ask again    274.08 - 277.75899999999996 : and then because the output on the right    276.639 - 278.56 : has kind of started getting kind of    277.759 - 280.96000000000004 : clutter    278.56 - 282.56 : we can use this button this x mark to    280.96 - 284.4 : remove all the cell output    282.56 - 286.56 : and then we can run the cell again and    284.4 - 288.32 : now the magic works it populates the    286.56 - 292.32 : interactive namespace    288.32 - 294.32 : we get everything that we want and then    292.32 - 295.68 : we can do stuff that we would normally    294.32 - 299.52 : be doing in a notebook so    295.68 - 300.08 : make a plot and the plot shows up on the    299.52 - 301.919 : right    300.08 - 303.52 : it is in line and one of the nice    301.919 - 306.24 : benefits of using this    303.52 - 308.0 : is unlike in ipython notebook this plot    306.24 - 309.68 : is actually not being rasterized into    308.0 - 313.12 : something like a jpeg or a png    309.68 - 315.84000000000003 : instead instead it stays as an svg    313.12 - 317.759 : so we can actually zoom in and look at    315.84 - 320.32 : sort of the details    317.759 - 321.6 : so the basic main stays off cell-based    320.32 - 324.32 : execution of code    321.6 - 328.08000000000004 : and plotting and stuff like that works    324.32 - 328.08 : also there's special support for pandas    330.8 - 334.88 : when your output contains a pandas    332.4 - 336.32 : dataframe it gets formatted nicely    334.88 - 338.56 : and then one of the really cool things    336.32 - 340.8 : that you get here is also you can list    338.56 - 342.479 : all the variables that have been defined    340.8 - 344.24 : in this notebook right now we don't    342.479 - 346.32 : actually have any variables defined    344.24 - 347.84000000000003 : but if i set this data frame equal to    346.32 - 349.919 : something then i    347.84 - 352.08 : see what the variable is what the type    349.919 - 353.84 : is some information about it what its    352.08 - 355.59999999999997 : value is etc and i can double click on    353.84 - 356.88 : it and for data frames we also get this    355.6 - 358.40000000000003 : nice little data viewer    356.88 - 360.0 : where you can sort of sort things you    358.4 - 362.15999999999997 : know you kind of get an excel    360.0 - 363.919 : ish output almost for free which is kind    362.16 - 365.52000000000004 : of nice and then finally one of the    363.919 - 366.15999999999997 : really cool things that you can do here    365.52 - 367.75899999999996 : is    366.16 - 369.28000000000003 : because this is vs code we can go ahead    367.759 - 373.28000000000003 : and set breakpoints    369.28 - 375.59999999999997 : visually and then click debug cell    373.28 - 377.75899999999996 : and that launches this whole really nice    375.6 - 379.199 : visual debugger where you can view sort    377.759 - 379.68 : of all the variables that currently    379.199 - 381.36 : exist    379.68 - 382.96 : you know the locals and the globals for    381.36 - 384.88 : the python interpreter you can view the    382.96 - 387.12 : call stack kind of jump through it etc    384.88 - 394.0 : we can put watches on variables and then    387.12 - 395.68 : step through the code    394.0 - 397.199 : so yeah that's pretty much it you get in    395.68 - 398.479 : my opinion pretty much all the benefits    397.199 - 401.28000000000003 : of having a notebook    398.479 - 403.52 : but you can keep a normal text file that    401.28 - 404.79999999999995 : can be very quickly turned into a module    403.52 - 406.31899999999996 : and packaged and    404.8 - 408.08 : deployed and that's really really useful    406.319 - 408.72 : to me i hope this has also been useful    408.08 - 409.919 : to you    408.72 -

26.24 : and find it at this link    24.4 - 28.56 : if you scroll on down to the readme this    26.24 - 30.0 : is going to detail some of the setup    28.56 - 32.16 : steps that you're going to need to have    30.0 - 33.44 : this smoothly run within vs code    32.16 - 35.76 : specifically you're going to need to    33.44 - 38.239 : install anaconda and run a couple of    35.76 - 40.559 : commands and then connect to that con    38.239 - 42.0 : environment from within vs code now i    40.559 - 44.079 : won't be detailing that setup in this    42.0 - 45.44 : video but you are in luck because we do    44.079 - 47.28 : have another video that walks you    45.44 - 49.519999999999996 : through setting up anaconda with your    47.28 - 51.68 : jupiter notebooks and just a quick note    49.52 - 54.079 : you don't have to use anaconda to run    51.68 - 56.64 : jupiter notebooks in vs code but it does    54.079 - 58.079 : help out a lot in instances where your    56.64 - 61.199 : notebook might require a lot of    58.079 - 63.68 : dependencies or common python packages    61.199 - 65.36 : so in this instance it's really helpful    63.68 - 67.68 : all right so now let's head on over to    65.36 - 70.64 : vs code and take a look at this notebook    67.68 - 72.47900000000001 : so for this to run in my vs code setup i    70.64 - 74.64 : need to have the python extension    72.479 - 76.479 : installed and in turn that's going to    74.64 - 78.96000000000001 : also install the jupiter notebook    76.479 - 80.159 : extension and then i'm going to navigate    78.96 - 82.79899999999999 : over to    80.159 - 85.52000000000001 : the titanic notebook file    82.799 - 87.36000000000001 : and i also am already connected to the    85.52 - 89.119 : conda environment that i created with    87.36 - 91.439 : the initial setup and that's going to be    89.119 - 93.84 : called the gold and scenario environment    91.439 - 95.36 : before we start diving into running this    93.84 - 97.119 : notebook i want to do a really quick    95.36 - 99.68 : overview of the notebook experience in    97.119 - 100.479 : bs code and what the specific notebook    99.68 - 102.799 : does    100.479 - 104.56 : so not the most upbeat of topics but    102.799 - 106.56 : this notebook is going to be using    104.56 - 108.159 : machine learning algorithms to try to    106.56 - 110.56 : predict whether someone would survive    108.159 - 112.799 : the sinking of the titanic based on    110.56 - 114.479 : attributes in a data set    112.799 - 117.52000000000001 : if we take a look at our files this    114.479 - 119.759 : titanic data.csv file is going to be the    117.52 - 122.24 : data set that we are reading from and    119.759 - 124.399 : yes this is real world data    122.24 - 126.079 : now looking at the notebook there are    124.399 - 128.16 : several sections says notebook which you    126.079 - 130.64 : can see in this outline view in the    128.16 - 132.48 : bottom left of the screen    130.64 - 135.2 : and if we take a quick scroll through    132.48 - 137.04 : these we can see that this outline is    135.2 - 139.35999999999999 : generated from the markdown headers    137.04 - 140.64 : within this notebook so if i click on    139.36 - 142.48000000000002 : one of these headers    140.64 - 144.79999999999998 : we can see that it is just a markdown    142.48 - 146.959 : cell and to show that rendered markdown    144.8 - 148.16000000000003 : you can just hit this check mark here    146.959 - 150.31900000000002 : now when you're working at jupiter    148.16 - 152.239 : notebooks in vs code a lot of your time    150.319 - 154.0 : is going to be spent with this top    152.239 - 156.48000000000002 : toolbar up here    154.0 - 158.879 : you can add a new code cell and when i    156.48 - 161.51899999999998 : do that it automatically detects that i    158.879 - 163.51899999999998 : am using python as my language    161.519 - 165.59900000000002 : you can add a new markdown cell which    163.519 - 168.0 : again is going to show that markdown    165.599 - 169.44 : language in the bottom right you can run    168.0 - 171.599 : all cells which we are going to see in    169.44 - 173.92 : just a little bit clear the outputs of    171.599 - 175.44 : all your cells you can restart or    173.92 - 177.35999999999999 : interrupt your kernel    175.44 - 179.44 : you can open your variable explorer and    177.36 - 181.28 : your outline view and in the more    179.44 - 183.12 : actions there's a couple of customizable    181.28 - 185.84 : options there and you can also export    183.12 - 187.20000000000002 : files finally in the top right you will    185.84 - 189.20000000000002 : see the kernel that you are currently    187.2 - 191.599 : connected to and if you were to click    189.2 - 193.51899999999998 : that you could change that to the    191.599 - 195.35999999999999 : kernels that you have available i'm    193.519 - 198.4 : going to go ahead and kick off running    195.36 - 200.64000000000001 : this notebook by clicking the run all    198.4 - 202.48000000000002 : button on this toolbar    200.64 - 204.39999999999998 : so there are a lot of different cells in    202.48 - 205.76 : this notebook and i don't really want to    204.4 - 208.31900000000002 : have to scroll through to figure out    205.76 - 209.84 : what cell is running so you can see that    208.319 - 212.159 : in this toolbar as soon as i started    209.84 - 214.08 : running cells this nice go to running    212.159 - 215.84 : cell button popped up so i just click    214.08 - 217.92000000000002 : that and it's going to take me right to    215.84 - 220.31900000000002 : where the currently running cell is so a    217.92 - 223.28 : very quick way to navigate while you are    220.319 - 224.879 : running a notebook with multiple cells    223.28 - 226.959 : now that this has finished running one    224.879 - 228.879 : thing that we can do is open the    226.959 - 231.04 : variable explorer    228.879 - 232.64 : and this is going to do is pull up an    231.04 - 235.35999999999999 : entire list of all the variables that    232.64 - 237.83999999999997 : were defined during our notebook run so    235.36 - 239.76000000000002 : you can sort them by name by type    237.84 - 241.92000000000002 : however makes it easiest for you to    239.76 - 243.92 : visualize all of your variables    241.92 - 246.0 : and the other cool thing is    243.92 - 248.879 : that we have something called the data    246.0 - 250.48 : viewer so if we take a look at any of    248.879 - 252.64 : these variables that have this little    250.48 - 255.04 : pop-out icon next to it    252.64 - 257.919 : we can actually drill even deeper into    255.04 - 260.079 : that variable to see what exists in that    257.919 - 262.15999999999997 : variable so for example i'm going to    260.079 - 263.68 : take a closer look at this titanic data    262.16 - 265.52000000000004 : frame    263.68 - 268.24 : click this pop out here and the data    265.52 - 272.0 : viewer will open in a new tab and you    268.24 - 274.639 : can see i can now visualize this entire    272.0 - 277.84 : variable everything that is inside of it    274.639 - 279.36 : i can sort on various columns in the    277.84 - 282.4 : data frame    279.36 - 284.24 : i can filter on any of the different    282.4 - 286.23999999999995 : columns so that way it only gives us the    284.24 - 288.40000000000003 : data we're looking for and really this    286.24 - 290.24 : is just a great way to drill even deeper    288.4 - 292.71999999999997 : into the variables that you have access    290.24 - 294.56 : to from your notebook vs code provides    292.72 - 296.56 : great data visualization functionality    294.56 - 298.16 : for things like charts graphs and trees    296.56 - 299.84 : in jupiter notebooks    298.16 - 301.68 : i've skipped ahead to the decision tree    299.84 - 303.59999999999997 : section of this notebook and if we    301.68 - 305.52 : scroll down just a little you'll see we    303.6 - 307.6 : have this visualize tree method which    305.52 - 310.0 : prints out a nice image of our decision    307.6 - 312.16 : tree if you hover over then in the top    310.0 - 314.96 : right you'll see the copy to clipboard    312.16 - 317.12 : option the expand image or you can save    314.96 - 319.84 : this image to your file system    317.12 - 322.4 : i'm going to expand this image and we    319.84 - 325.52 : can see that a new tab pops up with that    322.4 - 328.08 : image in it and when that pops up you    325.52 - 331.12 : can interact with that image you can    328.08 - 332.88 : zoom out zoom in and drag around so that    331.12 - 335.12 : you can further inspect everything that    332.88 - 337.12 : is in this decision tree alright so    335.12 - 338.4 : let's head on back to    337.12 - 340.479 : the notebook    338.4 - 342.479 : so when i ran this notebook i did it    340.479 - 344.32 : using the run all functionality which    342.479 - 345.59999999999997 : ran all the cells in the notebook but    344.32 - 347.36 : you probably don't always want to run    345.6 - 348.56 : every single cell in your notebook i'm    347.36 - 350.56 : going to show you a couple of other ways    348.56 - 352.16 : that you can run your cell    350.56 - 353.84 : the first being that to the left you    352.16 - 356.32000000000005 : have this nice little play icon which    353.84 - 358.32 : lets you just execute that cell    356.32 - 361.36 : and then over to the right here we have    358.32 - 363.199 : a run by line option which when i click    361.36 - 364.96000000000004 : that icon we can see that it highlights    363.199 - 366.88 : the current line that i'm on and then i    364.96 - 369.75899999999996 : can either hit f10 or just continue    366.88 - 372.71999999999997 : hitting that run next line icon to then    369.759 - 375.12 : step through that entire cell so another    372.72 - 376.40000000000003 : really easy way to skip through there    375.12 - 378.24 : and then if you just want to you know    376.4 - 380.15999999999997 : stop running line by line you can click    378.24 - 381.68 : the continue execution to just go    380.16 - 383.44 : through the rest of the cell    381.68 - 385.28000000000003 : other options you have here for running    383.44 - 387.039 : is this execute above cell so that's    385.28 - 389.52 : going to execute all the cells above    387.039 - 391.199 : your currently highlighted cell and then    389.52 - 393.75899999999996 : you have the option to execute the    391.199 - 397.12 : current cell and all the cells below you    393.759 - 399.36 : can also do things like add break points    397.12 - 401.36 : and then debug your cell so that way you    399.36 - 403.52000000000004 : can run through and it will stop on any    401.36 - 405.28000000000003 : break points that you have specified    403.52 - 407.68 : now if you ever want to move any cells    405.28 - 409.919 : around it's very easy all you would do    407.68 - 410.88 : is just grab and hold    409.919 - 413.35999999999996 : this    410.88 - 415.12 : blue bar next to the cell and then drag    413.36 - 417.36 : it to wherever you need to go so one    415.12 - 419.44 : more time i'm clicking this blue bar i'm    417.36 - 420.40000000000003 : going to drag this up and stick it back    419.44 - 421.759 : up there    420.4 - 422.96 : and then if you want to collapse the    421.759 - 425.199 : cell all you have to do is then just    422.96 - 426.88 : single click that blue bar and that    425.199 - 430.08000000000004 : works for both the cell    426.88 - 430.08 : and that cell's outputs    431.44 - 436.16 : so i've been using the outline view in    433.68 - 437.84000000000003 : order to easily navigate among this    436.16 - 439.36 : notebook but that's not the only    437.84 - 441.52 : navigation technique that we have    439.36 - 443.36 : available in your notebook you can also    441.52 - 445.75899999999996 : use search functionality so i'm on a    443.36 - 448.40000000000003 : windows machine so i'm going to hit    445.759 - 450.639 : control f but you can also hit command f    448.4 - 453.599 : if you're on a mac and that's going to    450.639 - 455.759 : pop up this find navigation item in the    453.599 - 458.319 : top right and then i can just type in    455.759 - 460.88 : whatever search term i have and that's    458.319 - 463.03900000000004 : going to give me various results    460.88 - 464.8 : and you can also filter this based off    463.039 - 466.479 : of what exactly you want to be searching    464.8 - 468.8 : for so right now it's just going to be    466.479 - 471.199 : looking for that cell source wherever    468.8 - 473.84000000000003 : that decision happens    471.199 - 475.52000000000004 : if we add the cell output into that    473.84 - 477.599 : filter we can see we now have 10 results    475.52 - 479.75899999999996 : instead of 7 results    477.599 - 481.759 : and that's not gonna also show anything    479.759 - 482.96000000000004 : in the output and not just the source    481.759 - 484.47900000000004 : and then we can also add rendered    482.96 - 485.75899999999996 : markdown to that and we can see again    484.479 - 487.44 : that changes the number of search    485.759 - 489.599 : results available to us because we are    487.44 - 491.12 : changing that filter now one of the    489.599 - 493.12 : coolest things that we have available    491.12 - 494.8 : with vs code and jupyter notebooks is    493.12 - 496.479 : intellisense so i'm going to create a    494.8 - 498.24 : new code cell here    496.479 - 500.56 : and just show you what that intellisense    498.24 - 502.08 : looks like so i can start typing titanic    500.56 - 504.479 : data frame you can see i'm already    502.08 - 506.71999999999997 : getting intellisense popped up there    504.479 - 508.8 : i can just do dot and then let's say i    506.72 - 511.12 : want to do group by if i begin typing    508.8 - 514.159 : that it says oh hey do you mean group by    511.12 - 516.479 : yep i sure do i can sort and that will    514.159 - 519.279 : pop up any sort methods i have available    516.479 - 521.6800000000001 : to me on this variable and i can do    519.279 - 523.919 : things like getting different values    521.68 - 526.0799999999999 : so it just makes it really easy for you    523.919 - 527.92 : to have that native intellisense that's    526.08 - 529.839 : available to you in normal python    527.92 - 531.92 : programming but it's available to you    529.839 - 534.8000000000001 : now within these jupiter notebooks so it    531.92 - 536.7199999999999 : makes it a lot easier to track any of    534.8 - 538.56 : your errors and just really quickly code    536.72 - 540.88 : up a new cell all right so i've made    538.56 - 542.4799999999999 : these changes to this notebook file and    540.88 - 545.2 : i want to take a look at what that looks    542.48 - 547.519 : like in the source control explorer so    545.2 - 549.279 : vs code does a great job of tracking    547.519 - 551.6 : changes made to notebook files within    549.279 - 553.519 : source control if we scroll down the    551.6 - 555.6800000000001 : first change that was tracked is this    553.519 - 557.6 : output which just resulted from some    555.68 - 560.0 : warnings i got when i ran through the    557.6 -

249.599 : will get the version correctly okay    247.26 - 252.239 : now it's time to create our first    249.599 - 254.459 : angular app for that I will go to my D    252.239 - 258.12 : drive and here I already created a    254.459 - 261.239 : folder angularjs so I will open my    258.12 - 263.699 : command prompt on this    261.239 - 267.479 : folder or I can directly open this    263.699 - 271.38 : folder with vs code also so I am right    267.479 - 274.56 : clicking and clicking on open with code    271.38 - 277.259 : uh in case you don't have vs code    274.56 - 280.139 : already installed just go to the browser    277.259 - 283.91900000000004 : and download vs code and click on next    280.139 - 286.259 : next it will be installed correctly    283.919 - 288.84 : so as you can see the vs code has opened    286.259 - 291.6 : in the folder I wanted now you can use    288.84 - 294.23999999999995 : this terminal to create your angular app    291.6 - 296.46000000000004 : or you can also open the comment prompt    294.24 - 299.699 : on this folder as you can see I am    296.46 - 301.56 : typing CMD enter and the command prompt    299.699 - 303.90000000000003 : will open on this folder you can either    301.56 - 306.54 : use this terminal of command prompt or    303.9 - 309.419 : this terminal of vs code so I am using    306.54 - 313.34000000000003 : the terminal of vs code and for creating    309.419 - 317.24 : a new angular app I will use the command    313.34 - 323.28 : NG new and the name of my angular app    317.24 - 325.56 : let me give as NG new or NG app    323.28 - 327.539 : and click enter    325.56 - 330.12 : as you can see it is asking to add    327.539 - 332.21999999999997 : angular routing so I will type no    330.12 - 334.86 : because I don't want to add angular    332.22 - 336.41900000000004 : routing routing    334.86 - 341.47900000000004 : and    336.419 - 341.479 : then I will select the CSS and enter    341.58 - 346.56 : and as you can see it is getting created    343.74 - 351.259 : it will take some time to install the    346.56 - 351.259 : required packages for this app    352.32 - 357.96 : finally my angular app is created so as    355.68 - 360.24 : you can see here is the NG app inside    357.96 - 362.21999999999997 : that we have the source folder and    360.24 - 365.52 : inside that we have the app components    362.22 - 368.22 : and here we have the index.html file so    365.52 - 371.15999999999997 : I will delete this terminal I will open    368.22 - 373.40000000000003 : a new terminal well I not need not to    371.16 - 376.91900000000004 : delete that terminal also but okay fine    373.4 - 379.73999999999995 : uh so I opened this new terminal now the    376.919 - 382.21999999999997 : command to run the angular app is NG    379.74 - 382.22 : serve    382.38 - 387.919 : and click enter so this will open the    385.139 - 387.919 : angular app    388.74 - 392.639 : so as you can see the angular browser    390.96 - 395.75899999999996 : application bundle generation is    392.639 - 399.36 : complete uh the live server is listening    395.759 - 403.38 : at localhost 4200 this is the link HTTP    399.36 - 406.74 : localhost colon 4200 so if I open this    403.38 - 407.88 : link it will open the live server of    406.74 -

573.04 : that also so let's say when I type some    570.399 - 575.68 : query here let's say SE this extension    573.04 - 578.56 : is going to give me the options for the    575.68 - 583.3599999999999 : auto complete for example select    578.56 -

42.12 : one is the Min GW installation on our    40.379 - 45.36 : Windows machine and we need a visual    42.12 - 47.218999999999994 : studio extension called code Runner so    45.36 - 51.3 : this is the extension that we need and    47.219 - 53.7 : we first need to install the Min GW so    51.3 - 55.86 : let's begin by installing the Min GW so    53.7 - 58.14 : I'm starting from fresh I have removed    55.86 - 60.96 : the Min GW installation from my computer    58.14 - 62.64 : and I have also removed the code Runner    60.96 - 64.379 : extension from my visual studio code    62.64 - 67.08 : because I'm going to show you how to    64.379 - 68.93900000000001 : install and download both so first let's    67.08 - 71.64 : start by Min GW so in order to install    68.939 - 74.27999999999999 : the Min GW what you can do is you can go    71.64 - 76.43900000000001 : to your browser if it's Chrome you can    74.28 - 78.78 : go to your browser and in the Google you    76.439 - 81.0 : can search for Min GW and you will get    78.78 - 83.6 : this first result which says Ming GW    81.0 - 85.74 : Dash minimalist gnu for Windows download    83.6 -

201.9 : we need to go to the C drive where we    199.26 - 204.48 : installed the Min GW and in here we need    201.9 - 207.72 : to go to bin and we need to copy this    204.48 - 211.26 : URL from here now go to search bar and    207.72 -

266.699 : installed mint GW on our machine if you    264.66 - 268.91900000000004 : get any errors that means that you have    266.699 - 270.84000000000003 : done something wrong watch the video    268.919 - 273.38 : again and follow the steps very    270.84 - 273.38 : carefully    273.78 - 278.4 : now we have the Min GW installation and    276.66 - 280.68 : we have added the path in our    278.4 - 282.29999999999995 : environment variables now we can go to    280.68 - 285.18 : visual studio code    282.3 - 289.259 : and here go to extensions and search for    285.18 - 292.44 : code Runner and this is the extension    289.259 - 295.68 : that we are looking for code runner from    292.44 - 298.759 : Yoon Han click on it    295.68 - 298.759 : install it    301.02 - 305.58 : and after it's installed close this    303.84 - 309.53999999999996 : extension tab    305.58 - 312.53999999999996 : and let's give it a go so we have this C    309.54 - 315.86 : program here if I run it    312.54 - 319.86 : you can see I get the output if I say    315.86 - 319.86 : printf subscribe    320.4 - 327.29999999999995 : save the file run it again    323.94 -

188.26999999999998 : builds my image now how do you do that    186.8 - 189.8 : well you got to go to the doctor    188.27 - 191.60000000000002 : documentation you got to look up docker    189.8 - 193.73000000000002 : build and find out all the little    191.6 - 195.14 : commands but with vias code it's much    193.73 - 197.35999999999999 : much easier let me show you how easy    195.14 - 198.95 : this is to build this image so if you    197.36 - 201.32000000000002 : open your pallet which on the Mac is    198.95 - 202.91 : shift command P you're gonna type in    201.32 - 204.89 : docker now that you have the extension    202.91 - 208.25 : and you're gonna see this docker images    204.89 - 209.89999999999998 : build image click on that then it asked    208.25 - 213.11 : you to tag the image so I'm just gonna    209.9 - 214.61 : leave it Express docker colon latest I'm    213.11 - 217.16000000000003 : gonna hit enter and it's gonna start    214.61 - 219.23000000000002 : building my image and I'll check this    217.16 - 222.41 : out alright so I've already pre built it    219.23 - 224.84 : so it's it's all cached there so here's    222.41 - 226.67 : my step 1 through 7 it built    224.84 - 228.41 : successfully if you come up here you'll    226.67 - 230.80999999999997 : see the command they use docker build    228.41 - 232.60999999999999 : here's a couple of flags docker file and    230.81 - 235.4 : then it tags it with the tag we gave it    232.61 - 237.05 : and current directory so say you wanted    235.4 - 238.61 : to tweak something in that it's as    237.05 - 240.20000000000002 : simple as just coming down here hitting    238.61 - 241.46 : the UP button and then changing whatever    240.2 - 243.70999999999998 : you need but I don't need to change    241.46 - 245.78 : anything vs code building successfully    243.71 - 248.92000000000002 : now if I come over here and I look under    245.78 - 251.66 : images I should now have this Express    248.92 - 254.23999999999998 : docker image and there it is Express    251.66 - 256.7 : docker if I open that it says here's the    254.24 - 258.71000000000004 : tag it's the latest from a few seconds    256.7 - 261.02 : ago if i refresh that it's like 6    258.71 - 262.90999999999997 : minutes ago because I built it I think    261.02 - 264.34999999999997 : before I started doing this video and it    262.91 - 266.81 : hasn't changed since then so it still    264.35 - 268.61 : has that image so now I need to build    266.81 - 270.62 : this image how do I run it how do I spin    268.61 - 272.36 : up this container well you need to go    270.62 - 275.09000000000003 : back to the docker documentation and    272.36 - 277.1 : look up docker run but if you got vs    275.09 - 278.57 : code you don't have to check this out I    277.1 - 281.09000000000003 : just bring up that little command    278.57 - 284.3 : palette again and I type in docker and    281.09 - 287.33 : I'm gonna look for docker images run    284.3 - 289.28000000000003 : look at this here's the command docker    287.33 - 291.68 : images run I want to select what I want    289.28 - 293.86999999999995 : to run and I want to run Express docker    291.68 - 297.65000000000003 : let me click that I want to run the    293.87 - 299.54 : latest and here it is docker run as soon    297.65 - 301.45 : as I do that up here under containers    299.54 - 304.16 : I'm gonna see that now I have a running    301.45 - 306.12899999999996 : container Express docker is now running    304.16 - 307.47900000000004 : you'll see here the command    306.129 - 310.749 : they used to run that if you need to    307.479 - 313.449 : tweak it and so now air containers    310.749 - 314.11 : running how do I now pull that up in a    313.449 - 316.839 : web page    314.11 - 319.029 : well my port is 80 81 so obviously I    316.839 - 320.499 : could do a localhost:8080 one but it's    319.029 - 323.919 : much easier just to go to the container    320.499 - 329.589 : right click go to open and browser and    323.919 - 332.679 : watch this boom there's my app right    329.589 - 335.61899999999997 : there so I built the image    332.679 - 337.839 : I ran the image and I opened it up in my    335.619 - 340.65900000000005 : browser all from the yes code without    337.839 - 343.33 : having to touch the command line so    340.659 - 344.949 : let's say hey well as soon as this is    343.33 - 347.919 : done I need to tweak some files inside    344.949 - 349.779 : of the container how do you do that well    347.919 - 352.44899999999996 : you got to look up the docker exec    349.779 - 355.719 : command but you don't need to again we    352.449 - 359.949 : got vs code come here to vs code you can    355.719 - 364.11899999999997 : right click and go to attach shell click    359.949 - 367.089 : that just gonna run this and if you're    364.119 - 370.809 : on a PC it actually errors out but if    367.089 - 373.179 : you erase all of this to this point and    370.809 - 375.519 : just type in bash instead of all of that    373.179 - 378.63899999999995 : it runs but right here I'm inside the    375.519 - 381.309 : app so I can hit LS LS a to see    378.639 - 384.099 : everything and I see I have my files    381.309 - 386.319 : here I can go back one and there's my    384.099 - 388.269 : app directory that I built see that app    386.319 - 390.55 : so if I need to jump in here and tweak    388.269 - 392.499 : any files I can tweak it so that's    390.55 - 393.849 : really all I wanted to show you today if    392.499 - 394.92900000000003 : you're having trouble at docker you    393.849 - 398.529 : having trouble wrapping your head around    394.929 - 401.10999999999996 : it try doing everything from vs code    398.529 -

185.59900000000002 : website that we landed in in the video    184.64 - 187.599 : and    185.599 - 189.11999999999998 : now you need to    187.599 - 191.83999999999997 : install rust up    189.12 - 194.0 : by downloading either the 32-bit version    191.84 - 196.56 : or the 64-bit version    194.0 - 199.2 : for me 62-bit if you have 32-bit version    196.56 - 201.92000000000002 : then you can download it using this so    199.2 - 204.07999999999998 : if you don't know uh whether it's 64-bit    201.92 - 206.39999999999998 : or 32-bit what you can do is just search    204.08 - 208.48000000000002 : it up this pc and you can just    206.4 - 210.159 : right-click and properties    208.48 - 213.04 : and it's going to open up the settings    210.159 - 216.64 : and you can see here uh    213.04 - 218.72 : system type 64-bit operating system and    216.64 - 221.11999999999998 : this means that i have a 64-bit    218.72 - 224.239 : operating system if it's 32 for you then    221.12 - 227.12 : download the 32-bit version for it okay    224.239 - 230.48000000000002 : so i will go with 64 bit    227.12 - 230.48000000000002 : okay cool let's download it    230.959 - 238.159 : and see it's already downloaded and we    233.68 - 239.43900000000002 : can just install it with one click    238.159 - 242.79899999999998 : okay so    239.439 - 245.68 : so here it is the main setup    242.799 - 247.76000000000002 : here it says that uh    245.68 - 249.84 : number one proceed with the installation    247.76 - 253.28 : the default one what you need to do is    249.84 - 255.20000000000002 : just type one for the first one and just    253.28 - 257.84 : hit enter    255.2 - 259.199 : so yeah you can see that after you hit    257.84 - 261.51899999999995 : enter it    259.199 - 263.44 : does something and like    261.519 - 265.04 : rust is successfully    263.44 - 267.36 : installed great    265.04 - 269.52000000000004 : and you can just press enter key to    267.36 - 271.28000000000003 : continue    269.52 - 273.59999999999997 : yeah that's it we have successfully    271.28 - 275.67999999999995 : installed rust but you know for me it    273.6 - 278.16 : took like really less time it took    275.68 - 281.04 : around like one or two seconds because i    278.16 - 283.44 : already had like rust installed it just    281.04 - 286.88 : updated it if there was any update for    283.44 - 289.44 : you it's gonna take a bit longer like    286.88 - 292.0 : i don't know but it's gonna take some    289.44 - 293.84 : bit more time so be patient    292.0 - 297.12 : and that's it we have successfully    293.84 - 298.96 : installed rust up now we can get    297.12 - 302.16 : get to the main coding part the stuff    298.96 - 304.71999999999997 : with the visual studio code okay so    302.16 - 306.88000000000005 : let's open visual studio code first okay    304.72 - 308.96000000000004 : so i made this folder where i'm gonna    306.88 - 312.71999999999997 : show you everything in this video so    308.96 - 312.71999999999997 : let's open with code    313.68 - 318.639 : and so after it's open    316.8 - 323.8 : you need to go to the    318.639 - 323.8 : extension part and like search for rust    324.4 - 328.63899999999995 : and you need to click on the rust    326.08 - 331.19899999999996 : analyzer thing not the first one it's    328.639 - 333.12 : not in use no longer so    331.199 - 334.96000000000004 : click on the second one and you can    333.12 - 337.28000000000003 : install it from here there will be a    334.96 - 339.84 : install option for me it's already    337.28 - 343.19899999999996 : installed and that's it you can be you    339.84 - 344.63899999999995 : know easily coding now in rust in visual    343.199 - 347.28000000000003 : studio code    344.639 - 350.639 : so let's you know make uh make the    347.28 - 353.28 : project uh let's make the workspace    350.639 - 357.039 : let's uh type in    353.28 - 360.55999999999995 : cargo new and the workspace name let's    357.039 - 364.31899999999996 : name it yt underscore project    360.56 - 367.28000000000003 : and yeah that's it let's hit enter    364.319 - 369.759 : yeah so it says that created a new    367.28 - 373.28 : uh package called yt projects    369.759 - 375.759 : and that's it now you can see there's a    373.28 - 378.79999999999995 : folder called yt project there's another    375.759 - 382.56 : folder called src with getting ignore a    378.8 - 385.199 : main rust file and a cargo dot    382.56 - 386.0 : or like to ml whatever you want to call    385.199 - 387.12 : it    386.0 - 389.039 : and    387.12 - 391.52 : yeah and you can see that after it's    389.039 - 394.4 : open all the extensions are getting    391.52 - 396.08 : activated so you need to wait for it    394.4 - 397.59999999999997 : for me it's going to take a bit longer    396.08 - 400.96 : because you know my    397.6 - 403.6 : laptop is kind of slow uh so for you it    400.96 - 405.44 : it might be a bit faster so after    403.6 - 408.319 : everything is like set up then you can    405.44 - 409.759 : you know start coding with it so here is    408.319 - 412.24 : like the main    409.759 - 413.91900000000004 : rs file the main rust file where you can    412.24 - 416.96000000000004 : see our default    413.919 - 419.28 : function is already created and you can    416.96 - 421.12 : see there is print uh the hello world    419.28 - 423.75899999999996 : thing we can just change it and you know    421.12 - 425.44 : let's say a    423.759 - 427.36 : high    425.44 - 430.56 : high yt    427.36 - 431.44 : okay so let's save it and let's    430.56 - 434.8 : run    431.44 - 439.28 : run it but the rust analyzer isn't ready    434.8 - 439.28000000000003 : till now let's wait for it to get ready    445.68 - 449.759 : and you can see like there are many    447.759 - 452.16 : other files here like    449.759 - 453.12 : the the cargo lock then like the get    452.16 - 454.88000000000005 : ignore    453.12 - 456.56 : like there's a main    454.88 - 458.8 : mean rs file    456.56 - 460.56 : and you can see there's a run    458.8 - 462.24 : run slash uh    460.56 - 464.319 : debug button you can just click on it    462.24 - 467.199 : and it's gonna run mineral that's it    464.319 - 469.28000000000003 : that's as easy as that    467.199 - 473.199 : so you can see it's it's loading    469.28 - 474.63899999999995 : finished running yeah high yt    473.199 - 477.039 : that's it    474.639 - 479.28000000000003 : that's it for this video uh thanks for    477.039 - 480.8 : watching and whatever i said will be    479.28 - 482.08 : similar for    480.8 - 484.08 : uh you know for    482.08 - 486.639 : linux and mac    484.08 - 488.31899999999996 : i believe so the the installation is    486.639 - 490.16 : gonna be a bit different you you need to    488.319 - 493.44 : just install the    490.16 - 494.8 : this uh you just need to install the    493.44 - 497.68 : rust up    494.8 - 500.479 : app using this thing the the command    497.68 - 503.759 : and in your terminal and the rest of the    500.479 - 505.44 : things will be like similar okay so so    503.759 - 506.47900000000004 : that's it for this video thanks for    505.44 - 511.08 : watching    506.479 - 511.08 : see you guys in the next one bye "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Software usage starts at 5:14 and ends at 7:58"}]}

158.08 : website so what I'm going to do here is    155.599 - 160.23899999999998 : I'm going to log in with my Google    158.08 - 162.72 : account which is first easier you can    160.239 - 162.72 : also give a    162.879 - 166.67999999999998 : email so we're going to select my login    165.4 - 170.31900000000002 : over here and we're going to proceed    166.68 - 173.72 : into tab 9 it's going to ask me for some    170.319 - 173.72 : password please go    178.76 - 182.67999999999998 : ahead so now it tells me that you can    181.2 - 184.35999999999999 : close this tab and start working with    182.68 - 187.28 : this ID all right so awesome okay so    184.36 - 190.87900000000002 : let's close this tab let's go back to    187.28 - 190.879 : our this thing and let's open up the    205.12 - 211.68 : code all right so here now let me try to    208.12 - 211.68 : write one script    211.72 - 214.35999999999999 : so here if you    216.84 - 222.239 : see this automatically gives me the next    220.2 - 223.28 : suggestion okay you can either choose to    222.239 - 227.64000000000001 : accept    223.28 - 230.519 : it so now if I want to write like some    227.64 - 234.48 : logic other logic over    230.519 - 234.48000000000002 : here like if I go out of    238.68 - 241.68 : this    243.4 - 247.28 : now I can also use it to explain a    245.2 - 250.2 : section of my code suppose I go here and    247.28 - 252.12 : select I I select say explain code so    250.2 - 254.39999999999998 : like if I go here it gives me the    252.12 - 255.84 : options as to what all I can do I    254.4 - 258.84000000000003 : selected the explain code option I    255.84 - 261.28000000000003 : selected this block so let me see I'm    258.84 - 261.28 : going to click    268.6 - 273.8 : continue    271.6 - 276.36 : initially it takes some time to    273.8 - 277.639 : work so here it goes ahead and explains    276.36 - 279.40000000000003 : to me like you know what that code is    277.639 - 280.84000000000003 : doing which is really awesome okay and    279.4 - 283.71999999999997 : it also gives    280.84 - 285.11999999999995 : you the full details as to what    283.72 - 287.40000000000003 : functions it is doing and what else it    285.12 - 289.8 : is doing okay so we have this thing over    287.4 - 294.0 : here which is I feel really helpful for    289.8 - 294.0 : us so it will also explain your    296.28 - 300.28 : code and now we can also say generate    298.72 - 301.759 : test or we can write you know doc    300.28 - 304.4 : strings for code or you can also fix    301.759 - 307.08000000000004 : code now let's say suppose we have a    304.4 - 309.96 : error over here okay we not we have a    307.08 - 312.8 : syntax error over here now when we try    309.96 - 314.84 : to save this it's going to give an error    312.8 - 316.68 : so if I cover this part of the code and    314.84 - 320.08 : say fix    316.68 - 322.24 : code it takes some    320.08 - 327.12 : time so it's telling me a couple of    322.24 - 327.12 : Errors over here so it gives me the    327.4 - 331.479 : example of how to fix this    332.56 - 337.0 : so which is already great I can just fix    335.24 - 339.28000000000003 : it from here or I can just say insert    337.0 - 341.84 : and it replaces the whole thing all    339.28 - 343.59999999999997 : right so you can make a judgment call    341.84 - 345.88 : over here but what I'm saying over here    343.6 - 348.16 : is this is applicable for Java Python    345.88 - 351.28 : and it's extremely helpful so this is    348.16 - 353.8 : one of my top tools uh which I suggest    351.28 - 355.71999999999997 : especially in the world of AI now and    353.8 - 357.96000000000004 : this is one of the best extensions that    355.72 - 360.56 : is tab 9 which gives you AI suggestions    357.96 - 362.35999999999996 : for your code    360.56 - 365.199 : all    362.36 - 367.759 : right next one the next extension we'll    365.199 - 370.759 : look at code    367.759 -

11.120000000000001 : first of all we need to create a  <start>  8.84 - 14.2 : repository where we can push this so go  <start>  11.12 - 16.96 : to GitHub and create a new repository to  <start>  14.2 - 19.56 : create a new repository click on new  <start>  16.96 - 22.880000000000003 : here and just give this repository the  <start>  19.56 - 26.198999999999998 : project name so since my project is web  <start>  22.88 - 28.96 : project I just calls  <start>  26.199 - 31.119 : web-  <start>  28.96 - 32.8 : project okay and you can write  <start>  31.119 - 34.6 : description here if you want you can  <start>  32.8 - 36.64 : also make this a private repository and  <start>  34.6 - 39.52 : it will not be accessible to anyone else  <start>  36.64 - 42.480000000000004 : but I\\'ll just keep it as default for now  <start>  39.52 - 42.480000000000004 : and just click on create  <start>  43.48 - 48.879 : repository now our repository is created  <start>  46.44 - 51.32 : and this is the URL for the repository  <start>  48.879 - 55.16 : so you can just copy this or just click  <start>  51.32 - 57.52 : here to copy it and from next time what  <start>  55.16 - 60.0 : you can do is this is also the URL of  <start>  57.52 - 62.120000000000005 : the repository but you need to add Dot  <start>  60.0 - 65.04 : git in the end if you need to push to  <start>  62.12 - 67.67999999999999 : this URL or if you need to add this as a  <start>  65.04 - 70.32000000000001 : git origin where you can push it so once  <start>  67.68 - 73.799 : we have copied this go back to the  <start>  70.32 - 75.55999999999999 : project and here click on Terminal and  <start>  73.799 - 78.08000000000001 : click on new  <start>  75.56 - 79.72 : terminal once the terminal is open we  <start>  78.08 - 82.03999999999999 : need to initialize a git repository  <start>  79.72 - 83.96 : locally so that we can push it we cannot  <start>  82.04 - 85.68 : directly upload the folder there but  <start>  83.96 - 87.96 : what we need to do is create a git  <start>  85.68 - 91.56 : repository locally that can be pushed to  <start>  87.96 - 95.32 : remote git repository that is GitHub so  <start>  91.56 - 97.399 : type G IIT there is git in it and hit  <start>  95.32 - 99.83999999999999 : enter this will initialize a git  <start>  97.399 - 101.56 : repository here so as you can see once  <start>  99.84 - 103.43900000000001 : this is complete this has changed color  <start>  101.56 - 106.36 : and it has become green that means that  <start>  103.439 - 108.75899999999999 : we have initialized G here and after  <start>  106.36 - 111.439 : initializing git we need to add which  <start>  108.759 - 113.399 : files to add to git or which files will  <start>  111.439 - 114.75899999999999 : be tracked by git so there can be  <start>  113.399 - 116.52 : multiple files there can be a lot of  <start>  114.759 - 120.96 : files in a project so what we\\'ll do is  <start>  116.52 - 122.56 : we\\'ll just type git add Dot full stop so  <start>  120.96 - 124.83999999999999 : this means full stop or period this  <start>  122.56 - 127.159 : means that add all the files that will  <start>  124.84 - 128.679 : be tracked by G so if you have 100 files  <start>  127.159 - 132.92000000000002 : all those changes to those files will be  <start>  128.679 -

162.39999999999998 : should be pushed to our GitHub so I\\'ll  <start>  160.64 - 164.319 : just show you what it means in a minute  <start>  162.4 - 168.48000000000002 : now let\\'s see how we can push it now the  <start>  164.319 -

196.39999999999998 : right so we have not yet defined the  <start>  193.48 - 199.35999999999999 : original origin to be this URL so what  <start>  196.4 - 204.4 : we\\'ll do is we\\'ll Define that by typing  <start>  199.36 - 207.48000000000002 : this command get remote add origin and  <start>  204.4 - 209.56 : then that URL once we\\' have done this  <start>  207.48 - 212.11999999999998 : now we know what is our origin this is  <start>  209.56 - 216.64000000000001 : the origin so now we can push to origin  <start>  212.12 - 216.64000000000001 : and push to master branch of origin hit  <start>  217.519 - 221.68 : enter and this time as you can see it is  <start>  219.64 -

263.0 : be a push to GitHub so if I commit  <start>  260.84 - 267.79999999999995 : this and  <start>  263.0 - 268.72 : write change one hit enter okay and now  <start>  267.8 - 270.24 : I  <start>  268.72 - 272.6 : do  <start>  270.24 - 274.919 : comma change two what I\\'m unsure about  <start>  272.6 - 276.88 : change two so I not commit it I\\'ll just  <start>  274.919 - 279.71999999999997 : push commit still change one so what  <start>  276.88 - 282.0 : I\\'ll do is I\\'ll just push again right  <start>  279.72 - 283.88000000000005 : now what will happen is only the changes  <start>  282.0 - 285.44 : that has been committed will be pushed  <start>  283.88 - 287.4 : that means we have committed after  <start>  285.44 - 288.919 : change one but we did not commit after  <start>  287.4 - 293.71999999999997 : change two right so only change one will  <start>  288.919 - 296.08 : be pushed let\\'s verify this and reload  <start>  293.72 - 299.24 : this and as you can see change one is  <start>  296.08 - 301.35999999999996 : here but change two is not here because  <start>  299.24 - 302.759 : we didn\\'t not commit after change to  <start>  301.36 - 304.759 : this is how you can commit and push to  <start>  302.759 - 307.639 : GitHub if you have any questions let me  <start>  304.759 -

58.62 : share is that even though I\\'m going to  <start>  57.239 - 60.629 : be viewing the code from this machine  <start>  58.62 - 62.849999999999994 : over here I can continue using my own  <start>  60.629 - 63.69 : theme my own local UI extensions all  <start>  62.85 - 65.339 : those types of things  <start>  63.69 - 67.59 : now I\\'ve actually joined this session  <start>  65.339 - 69.17999999999999 : and you can see that I am viewing the  <start>  67.59 - 71.43 : same code is on this machine over here  <start>  69.18 - 73.17 : now because this is a shared session you  <start>  71.43 - 74.4 : can actually see where the other person  <start>  73.17 - 76.5 : is viewing and this is all happening in  <start>  74.4 - 78.27000000000001 : real time and if the other user goes and  <start>  76.5 - 79.86 : makes some edits here you can see that  <start>  78.27 - 82.11 : those edits are also reflected in real  <start>  79.86 - 83.82 : time this works both ways so now you can  <start>  82.11 - 86.49 : see where the other user is browsing  <start>  83.82 - 88.79899999999999 : through on the host machine as well now  <start>  86.49 - 90.39 : even though the guest machine started up  <start>  88.799 - 92.31 : in the file that was being viewed on the  <start>  90.39 - 93.57000000000001 : host machine over here I can actually  <start>  92.31 - 95.22 : browse through pretty much any file in  <start>  93.57 - 96.72 : the workspace so I can go and browse  <start>  95.22 - 99.329 : over into the debug folder if I wanted  <start>  96.72 - 100.71 : to go open up other folders over here my  <start>  99.329 - 102.75 : intellisense and those type of things  <start>  100.71 - 105.24 : those all just work even though I\\'m in 8  <start>  102.75 - 106.71 : this is not this workspace is not  <start>  105.24 - 109.28999999999999 : actually hosted in my local machine it  <start>  106.71 - 111.0 : is all coming from this remote 4 machine  <start>  109.29 - 112.68 : over here so I get all those features  <start>  111.0 - 114.689 : even though I am in this guest session  <start>  112.68 - 116.04 : so that\\'s a quick look at the live share  <start>  114.689 - 117.57 : extension there\\'s a ton about the  <start>  116.04 - 119.67 : functionality it has you can set up  <start>  117.57 - 122.189 : shared terminals for example to share  <start>  119.67 - 124.14 : debugging even share websites that you  <start>  122.189 - 126.0 : host in the S code or that you start  <start>  124.14 - 128.31 : from BS code you can share those between  <start>  126.0 - 130.11 : the guest machine and the host machine  <start>  128.31 - 131.73 : as well I find that live share is  <start>  130.11 - 133.34900000000002 : especially helpful when you\\'re wanting  <start>  131.73 - 133.63 : to quickly walk through a problem or if  <start>  133.349 - 135.31 : we think  <start>  133.63 - 137.29 : like remote interviews and not with so  <start>  135.31 - 139.21 : many teams being distributed and so many  <start>  137.29 - 142.04999999999998 : people working from home live share can  <start>  139.21 - 142.05 : be really invaluable <start>\"\\n',\n",

12.509 : to remove any headaches from kid rebase  <start>  10.53 - 18.81 : if you struggled with understanding how  <start>  12.509 - 21.39 : git rebase works keep watching now let\\'s  <start>  18.81 - 24.18 : have a look at git rebase that you  <start>  21.39 - 27.810000000000002 : probably have heard a lot about but you  <start>  24.18 - 29.369 : probably scared to use at all ok so some  <start>  27.81 - 32.94 : people say git rebase is very dangerous  <start>  29.369 - 34.739 : don\\'t use it and some people are using  <start>  32.94 - 37.53 : it without any headaches so in this  <start>  34.739 - 40.5 : video we will try to explain how git  <start>  37.53 - 42.75 : rebase works and then you know when to  <start>  40.5 - 45.329 : use it and when to stay away from it  <start>  42.75 - 47.879 : ok so you will definitely know that git  <start>  45.329 - 51.03 : rebase and git merge are very similar  <start>  47.879 - 53.94 : they help you to bring changes from  <start>  51.03 - 56.07 : another branch into yours ok so this is  <start>  53.94 - 58.079 : the graph that you\\'ve seen in the git  <start>  56.07 - 61.829 : merge video so if you haven\\'t seen it go  <start>  58.079 - 64.08 : check it out and we are making a merge  <start>  61.829 - 66.78 : commit when we try to bring in his  <start>  64.08 - 68.97 : changes to my branch ok so this is the  <start>  66.78 - 72.71000000000001 : merge commit and then we can keep  <start>  68.97 - 72.71 : working on our feature branch  <start>  75.01 - 82.9 : now let\\'s do the git rebase okay so this  <start>  79.36 - 85.0 : is the point that I\\'m at in vs code when  <start>  82.9 - 88.54 : we switch to the code this is the point  <start>  85.0 - 90.76 : we have three commits in my branch ABC  <start>  88.54 - 94.60000000000001 : and then we have two comets in his  <start>  90.76 - 99.07000000000001 : branch a a and B B now let\\'s have a look  <start>  94.6 - 105.53999999999999 : at the get lock we have ABC comets on my  <start>  99.07 - 109.24 : branch and if we check out his branch  <start>  105.54 - 111.7 : you\\'ll see that the lock shows the a B  <start>  109.24 - 115.99 : commits at that point we\\'ve created the  <start>  111.7 - 118.84 : branch and we have the KNVB commit okay  <start>  115.99 - 121.44999999999999 : if you can see I\\'m also typing just get  <start>  118.84 - 124.12 : ello not get lock and the one line  <start>  121.45 - 126.13 : that\\'s the alias of setup so if you  <start>  124.12 - 128.41 : don\\'t know how to setup get Aaliyah\\'s  <start>  126.13 - 131.14 : check out some of the git config videos  <start>  128.41 - 134.47 : in this playlist in the get tutorials  <start>  131.14 - 140.52999999999997 : playlist now we\\'ll check out again my  <start>  134.47 - 143.41 : branch and we\\'ll do the rebase git  <start>  140.53 - 147.79 : rebase this branch will take his changes  <start>  143.41 - 151.45 : and put my changes aside apply his  <start>  147.79 - 153.94 : changes and then one commit by one will  <start>  151.45 - 155.35 : try to reapply my changes okay so we\\'ll  <start>  153.94 - 157.51 : show it a little bit later in the  <start>  155.35 - 160.15 : presentation but for now that\\'s what\\'s  <start>  157.51 - 163.959 : gonna happen and I will also add the  <start>  160.15 - 165.97 : flag I for interactive so you see what\\'s  <start>  163.959 - 168.13 : happening okay if I didn\\'t include the I  <start>  165.97 - 171.1 : it would just happen and we would just  <start>  168.13 - 173.32 : see the outcome like with merge but if  <start>  171.1 - 176.14 : we add the I maybe it will give you a  <start>  173.32 - 178.93 : little bit more hint of what\\'s happening  <start>  176.14 - 182.67999999999998 : behind the scenes so git rebase I for  <start>  178.93 - 186.73000000000002 : interactive his branch and now we have  <start>  182.68 - 189.19 : the comets being replayed on his branch  <start>  186.73 - 192.97 : soda as I said might change my commits  <start>  189.19 - 195.88 : the cecum it was put aside his changes  <start>  192.97 - 199.09 : were brought in and now my changes are  <start>  195.88 - 201.54999999999998 : one commit by one being replayed over  <start>  199.09 - 204.04 : his changes and here we have an option  <start>  201.55 - 206.079 : to either pick some of these comments at  <start>  204.04 - 208.23999999999998 : the moment we have only did one but you  <start>  206.079 - 211.09 : would see a list of comets  <start>  208.24 - 214.06 : over here that you can interact with  <start>  211.09 - 216.52 : okay and you can change the way they  <start>  214.06 - 218.68 : will be dealt with so first one is pick  <start>  216.52 - 220.87 : that\\'s the default value so if we didn\\'t  <start>  218.68 - 222.61 : change anything all the comments would  <start>  220.87 - 226.9 : be picked and they would be replayed  <start>  222.61 - 229.63000000000002 : over his changes will type in : and cue  <start>  226.9 - 232.15 : to quit and that\\'s it now we\\'ve  <start>  229.63 - 235.26999999999998 : successfully rebased our branch and  <start>  232.15 - 238.09 : brought in his changes and as you can  <start>  235.27 - 239.8 : see in the resulting rebase text file  <start>  238.09 - 241.84 : okay so we\\'ve got all three comments  <start>  239.8 - 244.69 : from my branch two commits from his  <start>  241.84 - 246.34 : branch and that\\'s it we had no marriage  <start>  244.69 - 248.98 : conflict because obviously I\\'ve got  <start>  246.34 - 251.5 : simple changes and I didn\\'t want to  <start>  248.98 - 253.72 : confuse you with merge conflicts but as  <start>  251.5 - 256.989 : long as you understand how the rebase  <start>  253.72 - 259.57 : works then you know that the resolving  <start>  256.989 - 262.71999999999997 : conflicts is exactly the same in rebase  <start>  259.57 - 265.24 : than in git merge okay so let\\'s go back  <start>  262.72 - 267.13000000000005 : to the presentation and now let\\'s have a  <start>  265.24 - 269.89 : look at again visually on what\\'s  <start>  267.13 - 273.07 : happened in vs code we run the git  <start>  269.89 - 277.12 : rebase his branch that would put my  <start>  273.07 - 280.54 : changes aside bring in his changes and  <start>  277.12 - 283.3 : then reapply the comments that we pick  <start>  280.54 - 286.3 : at the moment we picked only the one on  <start>  283.3 - 290.91 : to my branch okay so this will be the  <start>  286.3 - 294.01 : resulting line of comments and we are  <start>  290.91 - 297.28000000000003 : creating new commits for the changes we  <start>  294.01 - 300.13 : reapplying okay so the hash the ID of  <start>  297.28 - 301.80999999999995 : this commit would change and that\\'s  <start>  300.13 - 305.44 : exactly the dangerous part about  <start>  301.81 - 308.17 : rebasing because the new changes are  <start>  305.44 - 310.71999999999997 : rewriting the history so if someone else  <start>  308.17 - 313.3 : would checked out your branch or  <start>  310.72 - 316.69000000000005 : branched out of your branch before you  <start>  313.3 - 319.81 : rebase yours then it would be really  <start>  316.69 - 322.62 : hard to figure out what the history of  <start>  319.81 - 325.12 : each branch is just to summarise we  <start>  322.62 - 328.15 : replayed the comments on top of the new  <start>  325.12 - 331.6 : base which in our case was his branch  <start>  328.15 - 334.0 : and rebase rewrites the history by  <start>  331.6 - 336.70000000000005 : creating new comets okay so this is the  <start>  334.0 - 339.22 : important part of our rebasing once you  <start>  336.7 - 340.94 : rebase the comments that it tries to  <start>  339.22 - 343.25 : reapply  <start>  340.94 - 345.41 : our new comments with the same changes  <start>  343.25 - 349.1 : but new IDs and that creates the  <start>  345.41 - 351.68 : headache and it keeps the get history  <start>  349.1 - 354.05 : clean so the the line of comments it\\'s  <start>  351.68 - 356.75 : much cleaner than if you using git merge  <start>  354.05 - 362.27000000000004 : so if your team prefers cleaner history  <start>  356.75 - 365.63 : then rebase is the way to go some points  <start>  362.27 - 367.82 : of and when to use rebase and when not I  <start>  365.63 - 370.49 : think it\\'s very safe to rebase your own  <start>  367.82 - 373.04 : local branches that no one else checked  <start>  370.49 - 374.81 : out no one else is working on it\\'s only  <start>  373.04 - 377.0 : yourself trying to bring in other  <start>  374.81 - 379.76 : changes into your brain so rebasing in  <start>  377.0 - 383.24 : that case is safe but don\\'t rebase  <start>  379.76 - 386.45 : public branches like master you can also  <start>  383.24 - 390.26 : undo git rebase using git ref lock and  <start>  386.45 - 392.3 : git reset that I\\'ll try to cover in next  <start>  390.26 - 394.06 : videos let me know in the comments if  <start>  392.3 - 396.47 : that\\'s something you would like to see  <start>  394.06 - 399.35 : so hopefully that makes no more sense  <start>  396.47 - 402.02000000000004 : and you\\'re more comfortable to rebasing  <start>  399.35 - 404.90000000000003 : your own branches and I went back to es  <start>  402.02 - 407.83 : code edit two more comments D and E and  <start>  404.9 - 411.08 : we\\'ll try to do the git rebase again and  <start>  407.83 - 413.84 : we should see multiple comments being  <start>  411.08 - 417.5 : reapplied okay so we have a look at the  <start>  413.84 - 420.56 : log applying see applying D and applying  <start>  417.5 - 423.65 : e so this is the this is the message  <start>  420.56 - 425.66 : from the git log what\\'s happening behind  <start>  423.65 - 427.78999999999996 : the scenes and I think it\\'s very  <start>  425.66 - 429.95000000000005 : important that you understand now what\\'s  <start>  427.79 - 432.8 : happening that all three comments were  <start>  429.95 - 435.65 : put aside and then one by one they were  <start>  432.8 - 439.43 : reapplied on the changes from his branch  <start>  435.65 - 442.03999999999996 : I hope that git rebase is now a much  <start>  439.43 - 444.02 : more clearer to you than seven minutes  <start>  442.04 - 446.45000000000005 : ago okay if you\\'ve listened to this  <start>  444.02 - 449.06 : video on a double speed then probably  <start>  446.45 - 451.64 : shorter but hopefully you\\'ve enjoyed  <start>  449.06 - 453.59 : this video and if you did let me know in  <start>  451.64 - 456.11 : the comments what else would you want me  <start>  453.59 - 457.78999999999996 : to cover in the next videos and don\\'t  <start>  456.11 - 460.01 : forget to smash the like button or  <start>  457.79 - 462.71000000000004 : subscribe to the channel for more videos  <start>  460.01 - 464.83 : like this until next time happy coding  <start>  462.71 - 465.2 : bye  <start>  464.83 - 468.57 : you  <start>  465.2 -

16.65 : software available in the market so you  <start>  13.71 - 20.07 : can also install any other editors but  <start>  16.65 - 23.07 : this is from Microsoft and it is free to  <start>  20.07 - 27.269 : download then I will show you how to  <start>  23.07 - 30.359 : install node and NPM and PM stands for  <start>  27.269 - 34.5 : node package manager so angular  <start>  30.359 - 37.410000000000004 : framework is built on node.js and we  <start>  34.5 - 41.7 : need NPM to install different packages  <start>  37.41 - 44.16 : during our development so I\\'ll show you  <start>  41.7 - 45.899 : how to install and configure node in a  <start>  44.16 - 48.36 : newer computer  <start>  45.899 - 52.230000000000004 : next I will be showing how to install  <start>  48.36 - 55.019999999999996 : angular CLI in the node terminal using  <start>  52.23 - 58.82899999999999 : node terminal inside Visual Studio code  <start>  55.02 - 63.539 : so then we will create a first angular  <start>  58.829 - 66.84 : app which is a basic app then finally  <start>  63.539 - 70.65 : it\\'s important always to create a backup  <start>  66.84 - 74.49000000000001 : and if it is a huge project we need  <start>  70.65 - 77.22 : version controlling and source code  <start>  74.49 - 81.36 : management software\\'s one of the popular  <start>  77.22 - 83.07 : of among it is github nowadays and I  <start>  81.36 - 86.22 : will show you how to create a basic  <start>  83.07 - 90.67999999999999 : repository in this video and further  <start>  86.22 - 93.84 : moving on I will show you in-depth  <start>  90.68 - 95.759 : concepts of github so in this video I  <start>  93.84 - 100.549 : will show you how to create a basic  <start>  95.759 - 100.549 : repository in github using git techstop  <start>  101.329 - 107.25 : let\\'s see how to install Visual Studio  <start>  103.77 - 108.44999999999999 : code so go to this link this link will  <start>  107.25 - 111.03 : be in the description below  <start>  108.45 - 113.369 : inside this link you can find different  <start>  111.03 - 117.0 : version of software according to your  <start>  113.369 - 118.82 : computer for Windows download 64 or  <start>  117.0 - 121.68 : 32-bit accordingly  <start>  118.82 - 125.46 : once you download and install the Visual  <start>  121.68 - 128.12900000000002 : Studio code you can open and see  <start>  125.46 - 131.4 : something like this so moving on we will  <start>  128.129 - 134.91 : install a node and NPM  <start>  131.4 - 137.55 : to download node.js simply follow the  <start>  134.91 - 139.26 : link in the description so in this page  <start>  137.55 - 142.26000000000002 : you can see there are two versions of  <start>  139.26 - 144.89999999999998 : node.js one is NTS which is long-term  <start>  142.26 - 148.98 : supported version and one is current  <start>  144.9 - 152.16 : release version so it is recommended for  <start>  148.98 - 155.57999999999998 : most users to download LTS because it is  <start>  152.16 - 157.95 : a stable version of node.js so by  <start>  155.58 - 160.769 : clicking it install the download you  <start>  157.95 - 163.47 : know Jas and I have already done it so  <start>  160.769 - 166.44 : during installation you can see the  <start>  163.47 - 170.73 : node.js is installed in this no J\\'s  <start>  166.44 - 174.39 : folder in Program Files so in the next  <start>  170.73 - 178.2 : step you can see the NPM package manager  <start>  174.39 - 181.29 : is also a part of this installation so  <start>  178.2 - 184.04899999999998 : simply install by clicking next so I  <start>  181.29 - 188.31 : have already downloaded and installed  <start>  184.049 - 192.33 : node.js in my machine so I will simply  <start>  188.31 - 194.64000000000001 : cancel this installation and one more  <start>  192.33 - 196.769 : thing you need to make sure after the  <start>  194.64 - 200.07 : download so go to the environment  <start>  196.769 - 205.26 : variables in your system and there will  <start>  200.07 - 207.989 : be a variable path so it will be  <start>  205.26 - 209.66 : automatically done by the Installer but  <start>  207.989 - 213.359 : to make sure you have to check it  <start>  209.66 - 215.569 : otherwise no terminal will not work so  <start>  213.359 - 223.81900000000002 : you can see here there is a path  <start>  215.569 - 226.88899999999998 : specified for the NPM that is C  <start>  223.819 - 231.03 : administrate uses administrator app data  <start>  226.889 - 234.079 : roaming and then nvm there there should  <start>  231.03 - 241.069 : be one more path in the system variables  <start>  234.079 - 244.35000000000002 : there you must see the path for nodejs  <start>  241.069 - 248.1 : specified so these two should be there  <start>  244.35 - 251.28 : in the environment variables and make  <start>  248.1 - 255.9 : sure it is there so after this you can  <start>  251.28 - 261.239 : run node.js in the terminal of Visual  <start>  255.9 - 265.26 : Studio code and install angular CLI to  <start>  261.239 - 268.26 : install angular CLI open the visuals to  <start>  265.26 - 275.49 : your court and you can see the terminal  <start>  268.26 - 284.84999999999997 : here and click new terminal so in the  <start>  275.49 - 288.15000000000003 : terminal type NPM install - G this G  <start>  284.85 - 293.13 : represents that angular CLI will be  <start>  288.15 - 299.90999999999997 : installed globally then type that  <start>  293.13 - 303.0 : angular CLI at latest I am writing this  <start>  299.91 - 308.28000000000003 : latest so that the latest version of the  <start>  303.0 - 311.19 : angular CLI will get installed hit enter  <start>  308.28 - 317.58 : and wait for the terminal to install  <start>  311.19 - 321.09 : angular CLI in your system so once the  <start>  317.58 - 324.39 : CLI is installed in the computer you can  <start>  321.09 - 328.34999999999997 : see here that it has added 84 packages  <start>  324.39 - 331.14 : and few other information so angular CLI  <start>  328.35 - 334.41 : CLI basically means comma command line  <start>  331.14 - 338.03999999999996 : interface which gives various commands  <start>  334.41 - 342.09000000000003 : to manipulate angular code in the in  <start>  338.04 - 345.27000000000004 : your system so now you can use various  <start>  342.09 - 348.17999999999995 : angular commands to create projects and  <start>  345.27 - 352.14 : create and manipulate it so now I am  <start>  348.18 - 355.59000000000003 : going to create an angular project using  <start>  352.14 - 359.43 : angular CLI so for that type this  <start>  355.59 - 365.25 : command in the angular CLI terminal ng  <start>  359.43 - 369.77 : new and the project name so I\\'ll give  <start>  365.25 - 369.77 : the name to the project as first app  <start>  377.849 - 384.96999999999997 : when you hit Enter typing this command  <start>  382.11 - 388.389 : the terminal will ask you few questions  <start>  384.97 - 390.94000000000005 : so the first question will be like would  <start>  388.389 - 395.889 : you like to add angular routing it is  <start>  390.94 - 398.949 : always yes here I will explain what is  <start>  395.889 - 401.53000000000003 : routing later later in the end of course  <start>  398.949 - 403.41900000000004 : so the next question will be with style  <start>  401.53 - 405.58 : sheet format would you like to use so  <start>  403.419 - 413.71 : I\\'ll be using CSS you can select with  <start>  405.58 - 416.409 : various stylesheet formats so now you  <start>  413.71 - 425.4 : can see that angular is creating its  <start>  416.409 - 430.21 : first project so once the project is  <start>  425.4 - 435.60999999999996 : created and initialized you can just  <start>  430.21 - 441.63899999999995 : open it so here you can see the project  <start>  435.61 - 444.46000000000004 : is installed in C uses administrator by  <start>  441.639 - 449.58 : the name first app so to open it simply  <start>  444.46 - 449.58 : go to file then open folder  <start>  456.43 - 472.28000000000003 : here you can go to see and users  <start>  467.83 - 476.71999999999997 : demonstrator then you can here see there  <start>  472.28 - 482.38899999999995 : is a folder called first app simply open  <start>  476.72 - 487.52000000000004 : the folder so here you can see the first  <start>  482.389 - 490.25 : angular app created by angular CLI so  <start>  487.52 - 493.37 : you can just ignore this e to e folder  <start>  490.25 - 497.379 : this is for end-to-end testing and these  <start>  493.37 - 500.27 : are the node modules we installed using  <start>  497.379 - 503.97900000000004 : angular CLI so only thing we have to  <start>  500.27 - 509.0 : care about is the source folder inside  <start>  503.979 - 513.56 : there is a folder called app and there  <start>  509.0 - 519.38 : is a component or TS file by the name a  <start>  513.56 - 522.459 : p-- so we can just compile this again  <start>  519.38 - 522.459 : using the terminal  <start>  533.07 - 542.2 : here you can just type ng sir so this  <start>  538.87 - 544.75 : project will be compiled so initially we  <start>  542.2 - 546.73 : have only one component angular is made  <start>  544.75 - 552.31 : up of components I will be explaining in  <start>  546.73 - 557.34 : later courses so this compound has an  <start>  552.31 - 561.31 : HTML file where you can see there is a  <start>  557.34 - 566.89 : h1 tag which says welcome to title and  <start>  561.31 - 569.14 : this title is string interpolated I will  <start>  566.89 - 572.65 : explain this term also string  <start>  569.14 - 577.5699999999999 : interpolation and the same component app  <start>  572.65 - 579.55 : component have a variable name title so  <start>  577.57 - 583.7800000000001 : this is initial ID initialized with  <start>  579.55 - 587.68 : first app string so when we serve this  <start>  583.78 - 590.47 : when we compile this we can open and we  <start>  587.68 - 595.87 : can in real real time see the compiled a  <start>  590.47 - 600.51 : compiled code in most for 2 0 0 port so  <start>  595.87 - 604.5 : I\\'ll be showing you the first compiled  <start>  600.51 - 604.5 : project in Chrome now  <start>  606.0 - 612.46 : so once the angular serves this project  <start>  609.07 - 615.0600000000001 : you can see here that it is saying that  <start>  612.46 - 620.77 : you can open the browser at localhost  <start>  615.06 - 623.5 : for 200 where you can see this project  <start>  620.77 - 630.04 : in real time so I\\'ll just open the  <start>  623.5 - 637.51 : Chrome browser and paste this link and  <start>  630.04 - 640.51 : hit enter so here you can see this is  <start>  637.51 - 643.6899999999999 : the code which is already written in the  <start>  640.51 - 648.4 : project this comes by default so this is  <start>  643.69 - 651.1 : what it was written in HTML file you can  <start>  648.4 - 653.61 : see here that if I change this title  <start>  651.1 - 653.61 : variable  <start>  656.42 - 664.8499999999999 : and save it once you save it it it  <start>  661.65 - 672.18 : recompiles again automatically and  <start>  664.85 - 674.64 : serves it on the browser now it has been  <start>  672.18 - 682.16 : compiled successfully now if you go and  <start>  674.64 - 682.16 : see here that it is showing our string  <start>  684.59 - 691.26 : now we have created our first app so  <start>  687.72 - 695.07 : let\\'s put this project in github github  <start>  691.26 - 699.03 : is a cloud-based version control and  <start>  695.07 - 700.98 : source code management website so to put  <start>  699.03 - 703.68 : your project in github you need an  <start>  700.98 - 706.29 : account I have already created an  <start>  703.68 - 708.15 : account and I have logged in so here you  <start>  706.29 - 711.48 : can see I have all these repositories  <start>  708.15 - 714.6899999999999 : already so there are two ways to put  <start>  711.48 - 718.74 : your project into github cloud so one is  <start>  714.69 - 721.59 : git bash it is a way where you you type  <start>  718.74 - 724.8 : commands from the terminal and you put  <start>  721.59 - 727.14 : the code it is not that convenient at  <start>  724.8 - 731.0699999999999 : this point of time so there is another  <start>  727.14 - 734.13 : way get Dex github desktop so you can  <start>  731.07 - 736.95 : download the software in this link so  <start>  734.13 - 739.65 : this is in the description below so  <start>  736.95 - 745.2900000000001 : after downloading just open the github  <start>  739.65 - 748.41 : desktop you can see this screen so first  <start>  745.29 - 750.9 : thing you have to do is go to file click  <start>  748.41 - 754.41 : options here you can see there is a  <start>  750.9 - 756.75 : sign-in option so sign in with the same  <start>  754.41 - 761.75 : account which you created with github  <start>  756.75 - 761.75 : calm so I will let just log in now  <start>  775.55 - 783.39 : so now if we if we want to add our  <start>  779.93 - 787.4699999999999 : project into the new repository you can  <start>  783.39 - 794.87 : select add local repository and choose  <start>  787.47 - 798.6 : the path here our app is in first app  <start>  794.87 - 799.44 : folder select the folder and add  <start>  798.6 - 803.7 : repository  <start>  799.44 - 806.5200000000001 : once you select add repository locally  <start>  803.7 - 810.09 : your repository is created and you can  <start>  806.52 - 814.1999999999999 : see here changes so it is changing it is  <start>  810.09 - 816.72 : saying that you have changed a line of  <start>  814.2 - 818.6700000000001 : code here it is also showing that you  <start>  816.72 - 823.49 : have changed title is equal to first app  <start>  818.67 - 831.24 : into another string that we have done so  <start>  823.49 - 835.05 : what we have to do now is we every time  <start>  831.24 - 838.59 : when you want to push the changes to  <start>  835.05 - 844.4699999999999 : online cloud you need to give a comment  <start>  838.59 - 850.97 : here so I will give adding first code  <start>  844.47 - 850.97 : change then I can commit to the master  <start>  851.81 - 859.53 : so so now the code has been committed to  <start>  855.54 - 863.01 : the master master branch but it is still  <start>  859.53 - 867.74 : not in the online or cloud you can see I  <start>  863.01 - 872.49 : will if i refresh here there is no new  <start>  867.74 - 874.47 : repository is listed here so what have  <start>  872.49 - 877.89 : to do now is I have to publish  <start>  874.47 - 881.45 : repository to github so there is a logic  <start>  877.89 - 883.83 : behind why we do this why there is a  <start>  881.45 - 886.32 : two-step process  <start>  883.83 - 888.83 : what is committing to master I will put  <start>  886.32 - 891.9000000000001 : all these things in in a separate video  <start>  888.83 - 895.38 : soon so now what we have to do is  <start>  891.9 - 898.67 : publish repository with the name a first  <start>  895.38 - 898.67 : app the same name  <start>  899.97 - 906.97 : okay we can we cannot add this privately  <start>  904.089 - 910.33 : because you need to upgrade your data  <start>  906.97 - 913.6 : boxes so this repository all the  <start>  910.33 - 916.12 : repositories initially we will be public  <start>  913.6 - 918.49 : so you can also go into my repository  <start>  916.12 - 922.3 : and see my codes I will also put the  <start>  918.49 - 925.48 : github repositories link in the  <start>  922.3 - 927.88 : description you can little little small  <start>  925.48 - 930.85 : small projects on angular in my github  <start>  927.88 - 933.22 : account so they should not be private at  <start>  930.85 - 948.0 : this point of time you can click publish  <start>  933.22 - 948.0 : repository you can see the progress here  <start>  954.209 - 964.18 : now it is done so if I now go and  <start>  958.8 - 967.7199999999999 : refresh the online website you can see  <start>  964.18 - 972.8199999999999 : here there is a repository added if I go  <start>  967.72 - 977.14 : inside you can see the code whatever we  <start>  972.82 - 979.86 : had written here is stored here so it is  <start>  977.14 - 982.54 : a good practice every time when you  <start>  979.86 - 986.95 : finalize your code you push it to the  <start>  982.54 - 989.98 : github repository so that it is kind of  <start>  986.95 - 991.87 : backup and in a huge project there are  <start>  989.98 - 994.12 : there will be creating versions of  <start>  991.87 - 996.13 : software\\'s they will test the first  <start>  994.12 - 998.11 : version then move it to the master there  <start>  996.13 - 1000.63 : are different branches here I can create  <start>  998.11 - 1005.279 : different branches so I will teach all  <start>  1000.63 - 1008.04 : this in upcoming videos so thank you for  <start>  1005.279 - 1010.949 : watching and if you get any doubts  <start>  1008.04 - 1014.13 : please put it in the comments so I\\'ll be  <start>  1010.949 - 1015.329 : helping you as soon as possible thank  <start>  1014.13 - 1019.56 : you for watching and please subscribe  <start>  1015.329 - 1022.9799999999999 : for upcoming tutorial videos on angular  <start>  1019.56 - 1025.85 : we will start with all the basics and  <start>  1022.98 - 1029.85 : we\\'ll create as a separate project  <start>  1025.85 - 1030.99 : tutorial project in this series of  <start>  1029.85 - 1033.62 : tutorials  <start>  1030.99 - 1033.6200000000001 : thank you once again <start>\"\\n',\n",

10.24 : comeback video  <start>  7.919 - 12.16 : if you will i want it to be a simple one  <start>  10.24 - 14.08 : so today i\\'m gonna talk about  <start>  12.16 - 15.280000000000001 : one of my favorite features in visual  <start>  14.08 - 17.279 : studio code  <start>  15.28 - 18.8 : probably the only thing that keeps  <start>  17.279 - 19.359 : bringing me back to this editor even  <start>  18.8 - 21.76 : though my  <start>  19.359 - 23.840000000000003 : default editor is emacs and that is the  <start>  21.76 - 24.32 : python interactive mode in visual studio  <start>  23.84 - 26.64 : code  <start>  24.32 - 28.0 : now before we talk about the python  <start>  26.64 - 29.439 : interactive mode itself  <start>  28.0 - 31.439 : i want to take a moment to talk about  <start>  29.439 - 33.92 : the fact that visual studio code  <start>  31.439 - 35.76 : will actually open ipython notebooks  <start>  33.92 - 37.04 : just natively this is a relatively  <start>  35.76 - 37.839999999999996 : recent feature i think one year or  <start>  37.04 - 39.839999999999996 : something like that  <start>  37.84 - 42.239000000000004 : and to do that we can just do like open  <start>  39.84 - 42.239000000000004 : a file  <start>  43.44 - 46.399 : and then i have this running code  <start>  44.8 - 47.919999999999995 : example notebook that i got from the  <start>  46.399 - 49.36 : internet if i just click on that  <start>  47.92 - 50.879000000000005 : it\\'s going to do a few things first  <start>  49.36 - 51.6 : you\\'re going to see the json and then  <start>  50.879 - 53.36 : it\\'s going to run  <start>  51.6 - 55.36 : the notebook and what it\\'s doing  <start>  53.36 - 56.239 : actually is in the background it is  <start>  55.36 - 58.559 : running  <start>  56.239 - 60.16 : a jupyter server and then it is using  <start>  58.559 - 61.76 : that to serve this notebook  <start>  60.16 - 63.279999999999994 : effectively the same way that a browser  <start>  61.76 - 65.28 : might and then if you wanted your work  <start>  63.28 - 67.68 : to be inside a particular python  <start>  65.28 - 69.119 : virtual environment you actually get the  <start>  67.68 - 70.56 : ability to select the virtual  <start>  69.119 - 71.28 : environments similar to how you might be  <start>  70.56 - 73.68 : doing it in  <start>  71.28 - 74.72 : a normal python workflow in vs code note  <start>  73.68 - 76.64 : that to get to this point  <start>  74.72 - 78.88 : all i had to do was install the official  <start>  76.64 - 80.56 : python extension vs code handles  <start>  78.88 - 82.96 : basically everything else now you can  <start>  80.56 - 85.119 : see vs code shows me all the available  <start>  82.96 - 86.55999999999999 : global python environments and then i  <start>  85.119 - 87.36 : also made a virtual environment called  <start>  86.56 - 88.88 : test and  <start>  87.36 - 90.479 : that option is there as well this  <start>  88.88 - 92.79899999999999 : notebook functions  <start>  90.479 - 93.759 : almost exactly like a normal notebook so  <start>  92.799 - 95.43900000000001 : if i just hit  <start>  93.759 - 97.36 : shift enter on a cell it\\'ll run that  <start>  95.439 - 99.119 : cell or render markdown  <start>  97.36 - 101.6 : i can run this cell and then the value  <start>  99.119 - 104.72 : of a will be set to 10  <start>  101.6 - 106.479 : printouts show up as you expect  <start>  104.72 - 108.96 : and yeah it works just like a normal  <start>  106.479 - 109.92 : notebook now i love notebooks for  <start>  108.96 - 112.24 : prototyping  <start>  109.92 - 113.04 : and i use them or used to use them all  <start>  112.24 - 114.15899999999999 : the time  <start>  113.04 - 116.159 : but this feature that i\\'m going to talk  <start>  114.159 - 118.32000000000001 : about the python interactive mode  <start>  116.159 - 120.24000000000001 : has completely removed notebooks from my  <start>  118.32 - 123.19999999999999 : workflow  <start>  120.24 - 124.0 : so if i go ahead and open a new file and  <start>  123.2 - 128.08 : just save that  <start>  124.0 - 130.479 : as a python file  <start>  128.08 - 132.0 : this is a standard python file right now  <start>  130.479 - 134.31900000000002 : there\\'s not going to be anything special  <start>  132.0 - 136.0 : about it until  <start>  134.319 - 138.56 : i make this special comment and all of a  <start>  136.0 - 140.72 : sudden vs code gives me these options  <start>  138.56 - 142.72 : i can run this cell i can run this cell  <start>  140.72 - 143.44 : and run the cells below or i can debug  <start>  142.72 - 146.0 : the cell  <start>  143.44 - 147.84 : this looks an awful lot like a notebook  <start>  146.0 - 150.56 : so if i go ahead and write let\\'s say  <start>  147.84 - 150.56 : import os  <start>  150.959 - 154.959 : i did a control enter there which is  <start>  152.64 - 157.599 : standard notebook shortcut for  <start>  154.959 - 159.2 : running the cell but not advancing and  <start>  157.599 - 160.959 : what vs code does now  <start>  159.2 - 162.39999999999998 : is that it throws up this interactive  <start>  160.959 - 164.48 : window on the right  <start>  162.4 - 165.59900000000002 : and then in that window it actually ran  <start>  164.48 - 167.2 : the command  <start>  165.599 - 168.959 : that was in that cell i can go back to  <start>  167.2 - 171.51899999999998 : the cell and let\\'s say  <start>  168.959 - 172.72 : do shift enter and it\\'ll run that  <start>  171.519 - 174.08 : command again  <start>  172.72 - 175.92 : it\\'ll show me what that command is and  <start>  174.08 - 177.68 : if if it has any output  <start>  175.92 - 179.04 : we will see the output as well and then  <start>  177.68 - 180.31900000000002 : there\\'s also this icon that you can  <start>  179.04 - 182.56 : click to go to the code  <start>  180.319 - 184.56 : the the particular cell that generated  <start>  182.56 - 186.72 : that output so you can sort of keep  <start>  184.56 - 188.0 : these two pieces the code on the left  <start>  186.72 - 190.8 : and the output on the right  <start>  188.0 - 192.48 : in sync to some degree now if i were to  <start>  190.8 - 193.12 : write a command that produces an output  <start>  192.48 - 196.23899999999998 : for example  <start>  193.12 - 196.239 : os.list tires  <start>  196.56 - 200.72 : that output gets printed on the right as  <start>  198.159 - 203.76 : well this thing on the right  <start>  200.72 - 205.12 : it\\'s like a normal ipython shell  <start>  203.76 - 206.319 : on the bottom i actually get a prompt  <start>  205.12 - 207.76 : and it says you know you can type code  <start>  206.319 - 210.83999999999997 : here and press shift enter to run  <start>  207.76 - 212.64 : very similar to writing something in a  <start>  210.84 - 216.31900000000002 : cell so great  <start>  212.64 - 218.64 : we have a very basic text file  <start>  216.319 - 220.72 : just a normal.pi file but we can  <start>  218.64 - 222.48 : interact with it we can separate it out  <start>  220.72 - 224.319 : in the same way as a notebook  <start>  222.48 - 226.56 : this is amazing to me and i hope you\\'re  <start>  224.319 - 227.2 : excited as well now i\\'m pretty bad when  <start>  226.56 - 230.159 : it comes to  <start>  227.2 - 231.76 : abusing ipython magics and one of the  <start>  230.159 - 233.84 : cool things that this mode does is that  <start>  231.76 - 237.04 : you can actually keep those magic so  <start>  233.84 - 239.12 : the one unholy line that no one should  <start>  237.04 - 243.12 : ever ever run but we all run anyway  <start>  239.12 - 244.72 : pylab inline you can just run that  <start>  243.12 - 246.64000000000001 : oh and i get an error when i try to do  <start>  244.72 - 247.92 : that because i was not in the right  <start>  246.64 - 249.439 : virtual environment  <start>  247.92 - 251.439 : you can switch the virtual environment  <start>  249.439 - 252.4 : by clicking on this button on the lower  <start>  251.439 - 253.92 : left  <start>  252.4 - 255.59900000000002 : if i click on that it gives me the same  <start>  253.92 - 257.12 : options that i was showing before i want  <start>  255.599 - 258.71999999999997 : the test virtual environment because i  <start>  257.12 - 259.759 : have matplotlib installed in that so i  <start>  258.72 - 261.12 : click that  <start>  259.759 - 264.08000000000004 : and actually before we can run the cell  <start>  261.12 - 265.919 : again we have to restart  <start>  264.08 - 267.75899999999996 : the ipython kernel because we changed  <start>  265.919 - 269.919 : our virtual environment  <start>  267.759 - 271.759 : so we do that it says all variables will  <start>  269.919 - 274.08 : be lost i usually set that to yes and  <start>  271.759 - 276.639 : don\\'t ask again  <start>  274.08 - 277.75899999999996 : and then because the output on the right  <start>  276.639 - 278.56 : has kind of started getting kind of  <start>  277.759 - 280.96000000000004 : clutter  <start>  278.56 - 282.56 : we can use this button this x mark to  <start>  280.96 - 284.4 : remove all the cell output  <start>  282.56 - 286.56 : and then we can run the cell again and  <start>  284.4 - 288.32 : now the magic works it populates the  <start>  286.56 - 292.32 : interactive namespace  <start>  288.32 - 294.32 : we get everything that we want and then  <start>  292.32 - 295.68 : we can do stuff that we would normally  <start>  294.32 - 299.52 : be doing in a notebook so  <start>  295.68 - 300.08 : make a plot and the plot shows up on the  <start>  299.52 - 301.919 : right  <start>  300.08 - 303.52 : it is in line and one of the nice  <start>  301.919 - 306.24 : benefits of using this  <start>  303.52 - 308.0 : is unlike in ipython notebook this plot  <start>  306.24 - 309.68 : is actually not being rasterized into  <start>  308.0 - 313.12 : something like a jpeg or a png  <start>  309.68 - 315.84000000000003 : instead instead it stays as an svg  <start>  313.12 - 317.759 : so we can actually zoom in and look at  <start>  315.84 - 320.32 : sort of the details  <start>  317.759 - 321.6 : so the basic main stays off cell-based  <start>  320.32 - 324.32 : execution of code  <start>  321.6 - 328.08000000000004 : and plotting and stuff like that works  <start>  324.32 - 328.08 : also there\\'s special support for pandas  <start>  330.8 - 334.88 : when your output contains a pandas  <start>  332.4 - 336.32 : dataframe it gets formatted nicely  <start>  334.88 - 338.56 : and then one of the really cool things  <start>  336.32 - 340.8 : that you get here is also you can list  <start>  338.56 - 342.479 : all the variables that have been defined  <start>  340.8 - 344.24 : in this notebook right now we don\\'t  <start>  342.479 - 346.32 : actually have any variables defined  <start>  344.24 - 347.84000000000003 : but if i set this data frame equal to  <start>  346.32 - 349.919 : something then i  <start>  347.84 - 352.08 : see what the variable is what the type  <start>  349.919 - 353.84 : is some information about it what its  <start>  352.08 - 355.59999999999997 : value is etc and i can double click on  <start>  353.84 - 356.88 : it and for data frames we also get this  <start>  355.6 - 358.40000000000003 : nice little data viewer  <start>  356.88 - 360.0 : where you can sort of sort things you  <start>  358.4 - 362.15999999999997 : know you kind of get an excel  <start>  360.0 - 363.919 : ish output almost for free which is kind  <start>  362.16 - 365.52000000000004 : of nice and then finally one of the  <start>  363.919 - 366.15999999999997 : really cool things that you can do here  <start>  365.52 - 367.75899999999996 : is  <start>  366.16 - 369.28000000000003 : because this is vs code we can go ahead  <start>  367.759 - 373.28000000000003 : and set breakpoints  <start>  369.28 - 375.59999999999997 : visually and then click debug cell  <start>  373.28 - 377.75899999999996 : and that launches this whole really nice  <start>  375.6 - 379.199 : visual debugger where you can view sort  <start>  377.759 - 379.68 : of all the variables that currently  <start>  379.199 - 381.36 : exist  <start>  379.68 - 382.96 : you know the locals and the globals for  <start>  381.36 - 384.88 : the python interpreter you can view the  <start>  382.96 - 387.12 : call stack kind of jump through it etc  <start>  384.88 - 394.0 : we can put watches on variables and then  <start>  387.12 - 395.68 : step through the code  <start>  394.0 - 397.199 : so yeah that\\'s pretty much it you get in  <start>  395.68 - 398.479 : my opinion pretty much all the benefits  <start>  397.199 - 401.28000000000003 : of having a notebook  <start>  398.479 - 403.52 : but you can keep a normal text file that  <start>  401.28 - 404.79999999999995 : can be very quickly turned into a module  <start>  403.52 - 406.31899999999996 : and packaged and  <start>  404.8 - 408.08 : deployed and that\\'s really really useful  <start>  406.319 - 408.72 : to me i hope this has also been useful  <start>  408.08 - 409.919 : to you  <start>  408.72 - 411.84000000000003 : thank you very much for watching this  <start>  409.919 - 413.039 : video i hope you have been staying safe  <start>  411.84 - 415.44 : if you\\'re new to the channel please  <start>  413.039 -

8.24 : then you\\'ve come to the right place  <start>  6.72 - 10.16 : because today i\\'m going to walk you  <start>  8.24 - 11.84 : through using jupiter notebooks in vs  <start>  10.16 - 13.759 : code i\\'m going to be using a public  <start>  11.84 - 15.759 : github repo so you can follow along  <start>  13.759 - 17.199 : right with me this is the repo that  <start>  15.759 - 19.6 : we\\'re going to be working with it was  <start>  17.199 - 22.240000000000002 : created by claudia apm at microsoft and  <start>  19.6 - 24.400000000000002 : to follow along you can go ahead  <start>  22.24 - 26.24 : and find it at this link  <start>  24.4 - 28.56 : if you scroll on down to the readme this  <start>  26.24 - 30.0 : is going to detail some of the setup  <start>  28.56 - 32.16 : steps that you\\'re going to need to have  <start>  30.0 - 33.44 : this smoothly run within vs code  <start>  32.16 - 35.76 : specifically you\\'re going to need to  <start>  33.44 - 38.239 : install anaconda and run a couple of  <start>  35.76 - 40.559 : commands and then connect to that con  <start>  38.239 - 42.0 : environment from within vs code now i  <start>  40.559 - 44.079 : won\\'t be detailing that setup in this  <start>  42.0 - 45.44 : video but you are in luck because we do  <start>  44.079 - 47.28 : have another video that walks you  <start>  45.44 - 49.519999999999996 : through setting up anaconda with your  <start>  47.28 - 51.68 : jupiter notebooks and just a quick note  <start>  49.52 - 54.079 : you don\\'t have to use anaconda to run  <start>  51.68 - 56.64 : jupiter notebooks in vs code but it does  <start>  54.079 - 58.079 : help out a lot in instances where your  <start>  56.64 - 61.199 : notebook might require a lot of  <start>  58.079 - 63.68 : dependencies or common python packages  <start>  61.199 - 65.36 : so in this instance it\\'s really helpful  <start>  63.68 - 67.68 : all right so now let\\'s head on over to  <start>  65.36 - 70.64 : vs code and take a look at this notebook  <start>  67.68 - 72.47900000000001 : so for this to run in my vs code setup i  <start>  70.64 - 74.64 : need to have the python extension  <start>  72.479 - 76.479 : installed and in turn that\\'s going to  <start>  74.64 - 78.96000000000001 : also install the jupiter notebook  <start>  76.479 - 80.159 : extension and then i\\'m going to navigate  <start>  78.96 - 82.79899999999999 : over to  <start>  80.159 - 85.52000000000001 : the titanic notebook file  <start>  82.799 - 87.36000000000001 : and i also am already connected to the  <start>  85.52 - 89.119 : conda environment that i created with  <start>  87.36 - 91.439 : the initial setup and that\\'s going to be  <start>  89.119 - 93.84 : called the gold and scenario environment  <start>  91.439 - 95.36 : before we start diving into running this  <start>  93.84 - 97.119 : notebook i want to do a really quick  <start>  95.36 - 99.68 : overview of the notebook experience in  <start>  97.119 - 100.479 : bs code and what the specific notebook  <start>  99.68 - 102.799 : does  <start>  100.479 - 104.56 : so not the most upbeat of topics but  <start>  102.799 - 106.56 : this notebook is going to be using  <start>  104.56 - 108.159 : machine learning algorithms to try to  <start>  106.56 - 110.56 : predict whether someone would survive  <start>  108.159 - 112.799 : the sinking of the titanic based on  <start>  110.56 - 114.479 : attributes in a data set  <start>  112.799 - 117.52000000000001 : if we take a look at our files this  <start>  114.479 - 119.759 : titanic data.csv file is going to be the  <start>  117.52 - 122.24 : data set that we are reading from and  <start>  119.759 - 124.399 : yes this is real world data  <start>  122.24 - 126.079 : now looking at the notebook there are  <start>  124.399 - 128.16 : several sections says notebook which you  <start>  126.079 - 130.64 : can see in this outline view in the  <start>  128.16 - 132.48 : bottom left of the screen  <start>  130.64 - 135.2 : and if we take a quick scroll through  <start>  132.48 - 137.04 : these we can see that this outline is  <start>  135.2 - 139.35999999999999 : generated from the markdown headers  <start>  137.04 - 140.64 : within this notebook so if i click on  <start>  139.36 - 142.48000000000002 : one of these headers  <start>  140.64 - 144.79999999999998 : we can see that it is just a markdown  <start>  142.48 - 146.959 : cell and to show that rendered markdown  <start>  144.8 - 148.16000000000003 : you can just hit this check mark here  <start>  146.959 - 150.31900000000002 : now when you\\'re working at jupiter  <start>  148.16 - 152.239 : notebooks in vs code a lot of your time  <start>  150.319 - 154.0 : is going to be spent with this top  <start>  152.239 - 156.48000000000002 : toolbar up here  <start>  154.0 - 158.879 : you can add a new code cell and when i  <start>  156.48 - 161.51899999999998 : do that it automatically detects that i  <start>  158.879 - 163.51899999999998 : am using python as my language  <start>  161.519 - 165.59900000000002 : you can add a new markdown cell which  <start>  163.519 - 168.0 : again is going to show that markdown  <start>  165.599 - 169.44 : language in the bottom right you can run  <start>  168.0 - 171.599 : all cells which we are going to see in  <start>  169.44 - 173.92 : just a little bit clear the outputs of  <start>  171.599 - 175.44 : all your cells you can restart or  <start>  173.92 - 177.35999999999999 : interrupt your kernel  <start>  175.44 - 179.44 : you can open your variable explorer and  <start>  177.36 - 181.28 : your outline view and in the more  <start>  179.44 - 183.12 : actions there\\'s a couple of customizable  <start>  181.28 - 185.84 : options there and you can also export  <start>  183.12 - 187.20000000000002 : files finally in the top right you will  <start>  185.84 - 189.20000000000002 : see the kernel that you are currently  <start>  187.2 - 191.599 : connected to and if you were to click  <start>  189.2 - 193.51899999999998 : that you could change that to the  <start>  191.599 - 195.35999999999999 : kernels that you have available i\\'m  <start>  193.519 - 198.4 : going to go ahead and kick off running  <start>  195.36 - 200.64000000000001 : this notebook by clicking the run all  <start>  198.4 - 202.48000000000002 : button on this toolbar  <start>  200.64 - 204.39999999999998 : so there are a lot of different cells in  <start>  202.48 - 205.76 : this notebook and i don\\'t really want to  <start>  204.4 - 208.31900000000002 : have to scroll through to figure out  <start>  205.76 - 209.84 : what cell is running so you can see that  <start>  208.319 - 212.159 : in this toolbar as soon as i started  <start>  209.84 - 214.08 : running cells this nice go to running  <start>  212.159 - 215.84 : cell button popped up so i just click  <start>  214.08 - 217.92000000000002 : that and it\\'s going to take me right to  <start>  215.84 - 220.31900000000002 : where the currently running cell is so a  <start>  217.92 - 223.28 : very quick way to navigate while you are  <start>  220.319 - 224.879 : running a notebook with multiple cells  <start>  223.28 - 226.959 : now that this has finished running one  <start>  224.879 - 228.879 : thing that we can do is open the  <start>  226.959 - 231.04 : variable explorer  <start>  228.879 - 232.64 : and this is going to do is pull up an  <start>  231.04 - 235.35999999999999 : entire list of all the variables that  <start>  232.64 - 237.83999999999997 : were defined during our notebook run so  <start>  235.36 - 239.76000000000002 : you can sort them by name by type  <start>  237.84 - 241.92000000000002 : however makes it easiest for you to  <start>  239.76 - 243.92 : visualize all of your variables  <start>  241.92 - 246.0 : and the other cool thing is  <start>  243.92 - 248.879 : that we have something called the data  <start>  246.0 - 250.48 : viewer so if we take a look at any of  <start>  248.879 - 252.64 : these variables that have this little  <start>  250.48 - 255.04 : pop-out icon next to it  <start>  252.64 - 257.919 : we can actually drill even deeper into  <start>  255.04 - 260.079 : that variable to see what exists in that  <start>  257.919 - 262.15999999999997 : variable so for example i\\'m going to  <start>  260.079 - 263.68 : take a closer look at this titanic data  <start>  262.16 - 265.52000000000004 : frame  <start>  263.68 - 268.24 : click this pop out here and the data  <start>  265.52 - 272.0 : viewer will open in a new tab and you  <start>  268.24 - 274.639 : can see i can now visualize this entire  <start>  272.0 - 277.84 : variable everything that is inside of it  <start>  274.639 - 279.36 : i can sort on various columns in the  <start>  277.84 - 282.4 : data frame  <start>  279.36 - 284.24 : i can filter on any of the different  <start>  282.4 - 286.23999999999995 : columns so that way it only gives us the  <start>  284.24 - 288.40000000000003 : data we\\'re looking for and really this  <start>  286.24 - 290.24 : is just a great way to drill even deeper  <start>  288.4 - 292.71999999999997 : into the variables that you have access  <start>  290.24 - 294.56 : to from your notebook vs code provides  <start>  292.72 - 296.56 : great data visualization functionality  <start>  294.56 - 298.16 : for things like charts graphs and trees  <start>  296.56 - 299.84 : in jupiter notebooks  <start>  298.16 - 301.68 : i\\'ve skipped ahead to the decision tree  <start>  299.84 - 303.59999999999997 : section of this notebook and if we  <start>  301.68 - 305.52 : scroll down just a little you\\'ll see we  <start>  303.6 - 307.6 : have this visualize tree method which  <start>  305.52 - 310.0 : prints out a nice image of our decision  <start>  307.6 - 312.16 : tree if you hover over then in the top  <start>  310.0 - 314.96 : right you\\'ll see the copy to clipboard  <start>  312.16 - 317.12 : option the expand image or you can save  <start>  314.96 - 319.84 : this image to your file system  <start>  317.12 - 322.4 : i\\'m going to expand this image and we  <start>  319.84 - 325.52 : can see that a new tab pops up with that  <start>  322.4 - 328.08 : image in it and when that pops up you  <start>  325.52 - 331.12 : can interact with that image you can  <start>  328.08 - 332.88 : zoom out zoom in and drag around so that  <start>  331.12 - 335.12 : you can further inspect everything that  <start>  332.88 - 337.12 : is in this decision tree alright so  <start>  335.12 - 338.4 : let\\'s head on back to  <start>  337.12 - 340.479 : the notebook  <start>  338.4 - 342.479 : so when i ran this notebook i did it  <start>  340.479 - 344.32 : using the run all functionality which  <start>  342.479 - 345.59999999999997 : ran all the cells in the notebook but  <start>  344.32 - 347.36 : you probably don\\'t always want to run  <start>  345.6 - 348.56 : every single cell in your notebook i\\'m  <start>  347.36 - 350.56 : going to show you a couple of other ways  <start>  348.56 - 352.16 : that you can run your cell  <start>  350.56 - 353.84 : the first being that to the left you  <start>  352.16 - 356.32000000000005 : have this nice little play icon which  <start>  353.84 - 358.32 : lets you just execute that cell  <start>  356.32 - 361.36 : and then over to the right here we have  <start>  358.32 - 363.199 : a run by line option which when i click  <start>  361.36 - 364.96000000000004 : that icon we can see that it highlights  <start>  363.199 - 366.88 : the current line that i\\'m on and then i  <start>  364.96 - 369.75899999999996 : can either hit f10 or just continue  <start>  366.88 - 372.71999999999997 : hitting that run next line icon to then  <start>  369.759 - 375.12 : step through that entire cell so another  <start>  372.72 - 376.40000000000003 : really easy way to skip through there  <start>  375.12 - 378.24 : and then if you just want to you know  <start>  376.4 - 380.15999999999997 : stop running line by line you can click  <start>  378.24 - 381.68 : the continue execution to just go  <start>  380.16 - 383.44 : through the rest of the cell  <start>  381.68 - 385.28000000000003 : other options you have here for running  <start>  383.44 - 387.039 : is this execute above cell so that\\'s  <start>  385.28 - 389.52 : going to execute all the cells above  <start>  387.039 - 391.199 : your currently highlighted cell and then  <start>  389.52 - 393.75899999999996 : you have the option to execute the  <start>  391.199 - 397.12 : current cell and all the cells below you  <start>  393.759 - 399.36 : can also do things like add break points  <start>  397.12 - 401.36 : and then debug your cell so that way you  <start>  399.36 - 403.52000000000004 : can run through and it will stop on any  <start>  401.36 - 405.28000000000003 : break points that you have specified  <start>  403.52 - 407.68 : now if you ever want to move any cells  <start>  405.28 - 409.919 : around it\\'s very easy all you would do  <start>  407.68 - 410.88 : is just grab and hold  <start>  409.919 - 413.35999999999996 : this  <start>  410.88 - 415.12 : blue bar next to the cell and then drag  <start>  413.36 - 417.36 : it to wherever you need to go so one  <start>  415.12 - 419.44 : more time i\\'m clicking this blue bar i\\'m  <start>  417.36 - 420.40000000000003 : going to drag this up and stick it back  <start>  419.44 - 421.759 : up there  <start>  420.4 - 422.96 : and then if you want to collapse the  <start>  421.759 - 425.199 : cell all you have to do is then just  <start>  422.96 - 426.88 : single click that blue bar and that  <start>  425.199 - 430.08000000000004 : works for both the cell  <start>  426.88 - 430.08 : and that cell\\'s outputs  <start>  431.44 - 436.16 : so i\\'ve been using the outline view in  <start>  433.68 - 437.84000000000003 : order to easily navigate among this  <start>  436.16 - 439.36 : notebook but that\\'s not the only  <start>  437.84 - 441.52 : navigation technique that we have  <start>  439.36 - 443.36 : available in your notebook you can also  <start>  441.52 - 445.75899999999996 : use search functionality so i\\'m on a  <start>  443.36 - 448.40000000000003 : windows machine so i\\'m going to hit  <start>  445.759 - 450.639 : control f but you can also hit command f  <start>  448.4 - 453.599 : if you\\'re on a mac and that\\'s going to  <start>  450.639 - 455.759 : pop up this find navigation item in the  <start>  453.599 - 458.319 : top right and then i can just type in  <start>  455.759 - 460.88 : whatever search term i have and that\\'s  <start>  458.319 - 463.03900000000004 : going to give me various results  <start>  460.88 - 464.8 : and you can also filter this based off  <start>  463.039 - 466.479 : of what exactly you want to be searching  <start>  464.8 - 468.8 : for so right now it\\'s just going to be  <start>  466.479 - 471.199 : looking for that cell source wherever  <start>  468.8 - 473.84000000000003 : that decision happens  <start>  471.199 - 475.52000000000004 : if we add the cell output into that  <start>  473.84 - 477.599 : filter we can see we now have 10 results  <start>  475.52 - 479.75899999999996 : instead of 7 results  <start>  477.599 - 481.759 : and that\\'s not gonna also show anything  <start>  479.759 - 482.96000000000004 : in the output and not just the source  <start>  481.759 - 484.47900000000004 : and then we can also add rendered  <start>  482.96 - 485.75899999999996 : markdown to that and we can see again  <start>  484.479 - 487.44 : that changes the number of search  <start>  485.759 - 489.599 : results available to us because we are  <start>  487.44 - 491.12 : changing that filter now one of the  <start>  489.599 - 493.12 : coolest things that we have available  <start>  491.12 - 494.8 : with vs code and jupyter notebooks is  <start>  493.12 - 496.479 : intellisense so i\\'m going to create a  <start>  494.8 - 498.24 : new code cell here  <start>  496.479 - 500.56 : and just show you what that intellisense  <start>  498.24 - 502.08 : looks like so i can start typing titanic  <start>  500.56 - 504.479 : data frame you can see i\\'m already  <start>  502.08 - 506.71999999999997 : getting intellisense popped up there  <start>  504.479 - 508.8 : i can just do dot and then let\\'s say i  <start>  506.72 - 511.12 : want to do group by if i begin typing  <start>  508.8 - 514.159 : that it says oh hey do you mean group by  <start>  511.12 - 516.479 : yep i sure do i can sort and that will  <start>  514.159 - 519.279 : pop up any sort methods i have available  <start>  516.479 - 521.6800000000001 : to me on this variable and i can do  <start>  519.279 - 523.919 : things like getting different values  <start>  521.68 - 526.0799999999999 : so it just makes it really easy for you  <start>  523.919 - 527.92 : to have that native intellisense that\\'s  <start>  526.08 - 529.839 : available to you in normal python  <start>  527.92 - 531.92 : programming but it\\'s available to you  <start>  529.839 - 534.8000000000001 : now within these jupiter notebooks so it  <start>  531.92 - 536.7199999999999 : makes it a lot easier to track any of  <start>  534.8 - 538.56 : your errors and just really quickly code  <start>  536.72 - 540.88 : up a new cell all right so i\\'ve made  <start>  538.56 - 542.4799999999999 : these changes to this notebook file and  <start>  540.88 - 545.2 : i want to take a look at what that looks  <start>  542.48 - 547.519 : like in the source control explorer so  <start>  545.2 - 549.279 : vs code does a great job of tracking  <start>  547.519 - 551.6 : changes made to notebook files within  <start>  549.279 - 553.519 : source control if we scroll down the  <start>  551.6 - 555.6800000000001 : first change that was tracked is this  <start>  553.519 - 557.6 : output which just resulted from some  <start>  555.68 - 560.0 : warnings i got when i ran through the  <start>  557.6 - 561.519 : import statements and this differs from  <start>  560.0 - 563.76 : the file checked in so it\\'s being  <start>  561.519 - 566.0 : tracked as a change and it\\'s really easy  <start>  563.76 - 568.399 : to either revert this change with just a  <start>  566.0 - 570.399 : click or i can simply just collapse that  <start>  568.399 - 571.839 : output and continue through viewing the  <start>  570.399 - 573.6 : differences  <start>  571.839 - 575.7600000000001 : we scroll down a little further you can  <start>  573.6 - 577.6800000000001 : see this new cell that i added is very  <start>  575.76 - 580.16 : clearly marked you can see that there\\'s  <start>  577.68 - 582.16 : no cell before it and now we have the  <start>  580.16 - 584.24 : green to indicate that this was a cell  <start>  582.16 - 586.0 : that was added so finally after you\\'ve  <start>  584.24 - 588.08 : created this data analysis everything  <start>  586.0 - 589.76 : looks good you might want to be able to  <start>  588.08 - 592.1600000000001 : export it as a different file so that  <start>  589.76 - 595.12 : you can easily share it with others so i  <start>  592.16 - 596.88 : can easily do that in vs code with these  <start>  595.12 - 599.2 : three dots that go to the more actions  <start>  596.88 - 601.279 : in the toolbar and clicking the export  <start>  599.2 - 604.1600000000001 : option and you can see i have been  <start>  601.279 - 607.6 : prompted to export it as a python script  <start>  604.16 - 609.36 : html or pdf file so this is a very quick  <start>  607.6 - 611.36 : and easy way for you to save your  <start>  609.36 - 612.9590000000001 : notebook in a different format  <start>  611.36 - 614.9590000000001 : now that\\'s just the start of everything  <start>  612.959 - 617.8389999999999 : that you can do with vs code and jupyter  <start>  614.959 - 620.64 : notebooks from data visualization to  <start>  617.839 - 622.5600000000001 : easy navigation to intellisense if  <start>  620.64 - 624.48 : you\\'re working with jupyter notebooks vs  <start>  622.56 - 626.16 : code is the place to be and we have  <start>  624.48 - 628.0790000000001 : plenty of other jupiter content on our  <start>  626.16 - 630.0 : channel like five things you didn\\'t know  <start>  628.079 - 631.5999999999999 : that you can do with jupiter notebooks  <start>  630.0 -

111.479 : happening so I\\'ll have to fast forward  <start>  109.439 - 113.579 : this video so that we\\'ll get up when the  <start>  111.479 - 115.92 : installation is completed after some few  <start>  113.579 - 118.91999999999999 : seconds you you\\'ll receive a message  <start>  115.92 - 120.36 : that\\'s reached that that writes 0.0  <start>  118.92 - 122.57900000000001 : vulnerabilities and it\\'s a success  <start>  120.36 -

142.34 : CD with the app  <start>  142.379 - 146.099 : then listing different data in the right  <start>  144.599 - 149.28 : directory so inside the right direction  <start>  146.099 - 152.33999999999997 : just say npm  <start>  149.28 - 154.379 : Gran div  <start>  152.34 - 157.20000000000002 : and your application will open inside  <start>  154.379 - 160.62 : the browser by default my browser is on  <start>  157.2 - 162.83999999999997 : is inside inside Google Chrome  <start>  160.62 -

12.96 : create your first angular app for that  <start>  10.2 - 15.48 : you need to install node.js on your  <start>  12.96 - 19.14 : system if it is not installed previously  <start>  15.48 - 22.14 : then go to the node.js.org website as  <start>  19.14 - 24.0 : you can see here if you are using a  <start>  22.14 - 26.4 : Windows system then click on the Windows  <start>  24.0 - 28.859 : installer and if you are using a Mac  <start>  26.4 - 32.399 : then click on Mac  <start>  28.859 - 36.059000000000005 : uh for me I already downloaded the  <start>  32.399 - 38.76 : windows MSI installer so click double  <start>  36.059 - 41.959999999999994 : click on it  <start>  38.76 - 41.96 : then click on next  <start>  42.48 -

254.459 : angular app for that I will go to my D  <start>  252.239 - 258.12 : drive and here I already created a  <start>  254.459 - 261.239 : folder angularjs so I will open my  <start>  258.12 - 263.699 : command prompt on this  <start>  261.239 - 267.479 : folder or I can directly open this  <start>  263.699 - 271.38 : folder with vs code also so I am right  <start>  267.479 - 274.56 : clicking and clicking on open with code  <start>  271.38 - 277.259 : uh in case you don\\'t have vs code  <start>  274.56 - 280.139 : already installed just go to the browser  <start>  277.259 - 283.91900000000004 : and download vs code and click on next  <start>  280.139 - 286.259 : next it will be installed correctly  <start>  283.919 - 288.84 : so as you can see the vs code has opened  <start>  286.259 - 291.6 : in the folder I wanted now you can use  <start>  288.84 - 294.23999999999995 : this terminal to create your angular app  <start>  291.6 - 296.46000000000004 : or you can also open the comment prompt  <start>  294.24 - 299.699 : on this folder as you can see I am  <start>  296.46 - 301.56 : typing CMD enter and the command prompt  <start>  299.699 - 303.90000000000003 : will open on this folder you can either  <start>  301.56 - 306.54 : use this terminal of command prompt or  <start>  303.9 - 309.419 : this terminal of vs code so I am using  <start>  306.54 - 313.34000000000003 : the terminal of vs code and for creating  <start>  309.419 - 317.24 : a new angular app I will use the command  <start>  313.34 - 323.28 : NG new and the name of my angular app  <start>  317.24 - 325.56 : let me give as NG new or NG app  <start>  323.28 - 327.539 : and click enter  <start>  325.56 - 330.12 : as you can see it is asking to add  <start>  327.539 - 332.21999999999997 : angular routing so I will type no  <start>  330.12 - 334.86 : because I don\\'t want to add angular  <start>  332.22 - 336.41900000000004 : routing routing  <start>  334.86 - 341.47900000000004 : and  <start>  336.419 - 341.479 : then I will select the CSS and enter  <start>  341.58 - 346.56 : and as you can see it is getting created  <start>  343.74 - 351.259 : it will take some time to install the  <start>  346.56 - 351.259 : required packages for this app  <start>  352.32 - 357.96 : finally my angular app is created so as  <start>  355.68 - 360.24 : you can see here is the NG app inside  <start>  357.96 - 362.21999999999997 : that we have the source folder and  <start>  360.24 - 365.52 : inside that we have the app components  <start>  362.22 - 368.22 : and here we have the index.html file so  <start>  365.52 - 371.15999999999997 : I will delete this terminal I will open  <start>  368.22 - 373.40000000000003 : a new terminal well I not need not to  <start>  371.16 - 376.91900000000004 : delete that terminal also but okay fine  <start>  373.4 - 379.73999999999995 : uh so I opened this new terminal now the  <start>  376.919 - 382.21999999999997 : command to run the angular app is NG  <start>  379.74 - 382.22 : serve  <start>  382.38 - 387.919 : and click enter so this will open the  <start>  385.139 - 387.919 : angular app  <start>  388.74 - 392.639 : so as you can see the angular browser  <start>  390.96 - 395.75899999999996 : application bundle generation is  <start>  392.639 - 399.36 : complete uh the live server is listening  <start>  395.759 - 403.38 : at localhost 4200 this is the link HTTP  <start>  399.36 - 406.74 : localhost colon 4200 so if I open this  <start>  403.38 - 407.88 : link it will open the live server of  <start>  406.74 - 410.16 : angular  <start>  407.88 - 412.86 : so this is how you can create your first  <start>  410.16 - 415.259 : angular project I also showed you the  <start>  412.86 - 417.47900000000004 : installation process if you like this  <start>  415.259 -

43.52 : the full list of supported database  <start>  40.96 - 47.079 : systems you will be able to see in the  <start>  43.52 - 49.160000000000004 : read me section of uh this extension so  <start>  47.079 - 51.359 : first of all click on install which is  <start>  49.16 - 53.879 : going to install this  <start>  51.359 - 57.199 : extension now once this extension is  <start>  53.879 - 60.519 : installed there is a new icon which will  <start>  57.199 - 62.76 : appear here on the left hand bar R which  <start>  60.519 - 66.88 : is for SQL tools so I\\'m going to click  <start>  62.76 - 69.88 : on this uh icon here and let me close  <start>  66.88 - 73.32 : this uh extension and then I can click  <start>  69.88 - 76.56 : on new connection to create a new  <start>  73.32 - 79.52 : connection now in order to connect to  <start>  76.56 - 82.88 : the post gray SQL or any other database  <start>  79.52 - 87.03999999999999 : system this SQL tool extension requires  <start>  82.88 - 89.92 : the desired driver extension for that  <start>  87.04 - 92.84 : database system so in our case we will  <start>  89.92 - 96.479 : will be connecting the post gr SQL right  <start>  92.84 - 99.60000000000001 : so we need the driver extension which is  <start>  96.479 - 102.2 : for post G SQL so once again go to the  <start>  99.6 - 106.119 : extensions and then once again search  <start>  102.2 - 108.68 : for SQL tools and under SQL tools you  <start>  106.119 - 111.36 : will be able to see more options which  <start>  108.68 -

125.64 : SQL tools for postc SQL which is the  <start>  123.32 - 128.72 : required driver we need to connect to  <start>  125.64 - 131.44 : the SQL Server so just install this  <start>  128.72 - 134.2 : extension also if you\\'re using any other  <start>  131.44 - 137.4 : database then you need to install the  <start>  134.2 - 141.56 : required driver for that database which  <start>  137.4 - 144.44 : is related to SQL tools so once this uh  <start>  141.56 - 146.84 : is installed we can once again click on  <start>  144.44 - 149.35999999999999 : SQL tools option here and now when I  <start>  146.84 - 152.08 : click on add new connection I can see  <start>  149.36 - 155.4 : these two options I will click on post  <start>  152.08 - 159.04000000000002 : gr SQL here and then I need to provide  <start>  155.4 - 162.72 : the configuration of my post gray SQL  <start>  159.04 - 166.239 : Server so that I can connect to my post  <start>  162.72 - 169.84 : cray so here the connection name you can  <start>  166.239 - 172.31900000000002 : uh give any name here I\\'m using the post  <start>  169.84 - 176.64000000000001 : CR locally so I\\'m going to just uh name  <start>  172.319 - 178.39999999999998 : my connection as PG local here and then  <start>  176.64 - 180.72 : you can also provide a connection group  <start>  178.4 - 183.84 : I\\'m going to leave it as default  <start>  180.72 - 187.68 : now you can connect via the server and  <start>  183.84 - 189.31900000000002 : Port socket file or connection string  <start>  187.68 - 192.799 : I\\'m going to use the first option which  <start>  189.319 - 195.76 : is server and the port and then you need  <start>  192.799 - 198.239 : to provide the server address if you are  <start>  195.76 - 200.92 : running your postgre SQL locally just  <start>  198.239 -

211.48000000000002 : address of that machine and then the  <start>  209.4 - 215.439 : post Port the default port for  <start>  211.48 - 218.439 : connecting to the post SQL Server is  <start>  215.439 - 221.28 : 5432 if you are using some different  <start>  218.439 - 222.07999999999998 : port for your MySQL server just provide  <start>  221.28 - 224.799 : that  <start>  222.08 - 227.04000000000002 : here now in order to connect to your  <start>  224.799 - 229.68 : postre SQL Server you need to provide  <start>  227.04 - 233.12 : the name of the database which already  <start>  229.68 - 235.079 : pre-exist in your MySQL server so let\\'s  <start>  233.12 - 238.04 : say I have this database which is called  <start>  235.079 - 240.31900000000002 : demo which I have already created in my  <start>  238.04 - 244.12 : MySQL server so I need to provide the  <start>  240.319 - 246.11999999999998 : database name I want to connect to so  <start>  244.12 - 248.64000000000001 : here you need to provide the username  <start>  246.12 - 251.079 : which you use to connect to your MySQL  <start>  248.64 - 253.72 : server generally uh if you have  <start>  251.079 - 256.639 : installed postra freshly then the  <start>  253.72 - 259.0 : username will be postrace but it can be  <start>  256.639 - 261.52 : different also which depends on the  <start>  259.0 - 264.6 : settings of your post G SQL  <start>  261.52 - 267.03999999999996 : Server now here in the password section  <start>  264.6 - 270.28000000000003 : you have few different options like uh  <start>  267.04 -

280.12 : option which is going to save my  <start>  277.68 - 283.639 : password as the empty setting just for  <start>  280.12 - 287.08 : the Simplicity but if you are concerned  <start>  283.639 - 290.16 : about the security then I will ask you  <start>  287.08 - 293.0 : to use uh the first option or the second  <start>  290.16 - 295.72 : option here so I\\'m going to choose the  <start>  293.0 - 298.44 : last option which is save as plain text  <start>  295.72 - 301.759 : in settings because I have my post  <start>  298.44 - 305.36 : server running on my local machine so my  <start>  301.759 - 308.56 : password is really simple here and then  <start>  305.36 - 311.56 : when I move down a little it says node  <start>  308.56 - 315.24 : PG driver specific option if you\\'re  <start>  311.56 - 317.88 : using SSL then you can uh enable the SSL  <start>  315.24 -

330.759 : settings then you can give all these  <start>  328.919 - 333.44 : settings from here I\\'m going to leave  <start>  330.759 - 335.68 : everything as default and then you have  <start>  333.44 - 337.84 : this connection timeout option so I\\'m  <start>  335.68 - 341.0 : going to give this connection time out  <start>  337.84 - 343.59999999999997 : as 30 here and now I have given all the  <start>  341.0 - 345.8 : required configurations so here I have  <start>  343.6 - 347.759 : the option to save my connection but  <start>  345.8 - 349.28000000000003 : before that we can also test our  <start>  347.759 - 351.84000000000003 : connection by clicking on the test  <start>  349.28 - 353.88 : connection button so when I click on the  <start>  351.84 - 355.919 : test connection button I can see  <start>  353.88 -

262.32 : number of our GCC installation so it  <start>  260.22 - 264.66 : means that we have successfully  <start>  262.32 - 266.699 : installed mint GW on our machine if you  <start>  264.66 - 268.91900000000004 : get any errors that means that you have  <start>  266.699 - 270.84000000000003 : done something wrong watch the video  <start>  268.919 - 273.38 : again and follow the steps very  <start>  270.84 - 273.38 : carefully  <start>  273.78 - 278.4 : now we have the Min GW installation and  <start>  276.66 - 280.68 : we have added the path in our  <start>  278.4 - 282.29999999999995 : environment variables now we can go to  <start>  280.68 - 285.18 : visual studio code  <start>  282.3 - 289.259 : and here go to extensions and search for  <start>  285.18 - 292.44 : code Runner and this is the extension  <start>  289.259 - 295.68 : that we are looking for code runner from  <start>  292.44 - 298.759 : Yoon Han click on it  <start>  295.68 - 298.759 : install it  <start>  301.02 - 305.58 : and after it\\'s installed close this  <start>  303.84 - 309.53999999999996 : extension tab  <start>  305.58 - 312.53999999999996 : and let\\'s give it a go so we have this C  <start>  309.54 - 315.86 : program here if I run it  <start>  312.54 - 319.86 : you can see I get the output if I say  <start>  315.86 - 319.86 : printf subscribe  <start>  320.4 - 327.29999999999995 : save the file run it again  <start>  323.94 - 329.52 : you can see the output says subscribe so  <start>  327.3 - 331.32 : now that the C program is telling you to  <start>  329.52 - 333.71999999999997 : subscribe you shouldn\\'t ignore that  <start>  331.32 - 335.759 : message and you should subscribe to my  <start>  333.72 - 337.56 : channel and like this video so this is  <start>  335.759 - 341.66 : it for this video I\\'ll see you in the  <start>  337.56 -

11.82 : to manage docker better so you might be  <start>  9.87 - 13.768999999999998 : new to docker maybe they just asked you  <start>  11.82 - 15.66 : at work to start doing some docker stuff  <start>  13.769 - 17.88 : maybe it\\'s a hobby at home you\\'re just  <start>  15.66 - 19.65 : learning docker whatever it is it can be  <start>  17.88 - 21.99 : a bit confusing at first now this is not  <start>  19.65 - 24.24 : a video that explains how to install  <start>  21.99 - 26.369 : docker or the basics of docker like  <start>  24.24 - 27.869 : images and containers and layers and  <start>  26.369 - 29.22 : things like that I\\'m assuming you  <start>  27.869 - 30.779 : already know that if you want to see a  <start>  29.22 - 32.579 : video like that let me know down in the  <start>  30.779 - 34.38 : comments I\\'ll do it but in this video I  <start>  32.579 - 37.44 : want to show you a tool that just makes  <start>  34.38 - 39.489000000000004 : managing all of that easier  <start>  37.44 - 42.14 : [Music]  <start>  39.489 - 44.3 : all right so before we get started if  <start>  42.14 - 45.92 : you\\'re into web development coding if  <start>  44.3 - 48.31999999999999 : you\\'re learning to code if you\\'re into  <start>  45.92 - 50.300000000000004 : freelancing conquering life in general  <start>  48.32 - 51.980000000000004 : consider hitting that subscribe button  <start>  50.3 - 53.839 : below there\\'s lots of great videos on  <start>  51.98 - 55.909 : the way so if you\\'re new to docker you  <start>  53.839 - 57.44 : may have gone to docker hub pulled some  <start>  55.909 - 59.089 : image and then you\\'re kind of like  <start>  57.44 - 60.71 : where\\'s my image at I pulled it where\\'s  <start>  59.089 - 63.17 : it at and somebody goes hey just run  <start>  60.71 - 65.18 : docker images like this doctor images  <start>  63.17 - 66.68 : there\\'s your images and then you\\'re like  <start>  65.18 - 68.21000000000001 : well what do I do with this image how do  <start>  66.68 - 69.89 : I run it well you got to look up the  <start>  68.21 - 71.63 : command to run the image that spins up  <start>  69.89 - 73.159 : the container and then you\\'re like well  <start>  71.63 - 74.78 : I gotta get also get in that container  <start>  73.159 - 75.89 : make a few tweaks and you\\'re like how do  <start>  74.78 - 77.899 : I do that and they\\'re like oh that\\'s  <start>  75.89 - 80.75 : another command you gotta look up so for  <start>  77.899 - 82.88 : me it\\'s 20/20 I love the terminal and I  <start>  80.75 - 84.409 : do a lot in the command line but when I  <start>  82.88 - 87.08 : have some kind of interface that makes  <start>  84.409 - 89.72 : it easier I\\'m quick to grab and I found  <start>  87.08 - 91.52 : one that I use on a daily basis to  <start>  89.72 - 93.47 : manage all of this docker stuff and it\\'s  <start>  91.52 - 96.17 : one that millions of people use already  <start>  93.47 - 97.97 : it\\'s called vs code and they have a  <start>  96.17 - 99.74 : wonderful wonderful extension for  <start>  97.97 - 102.11 : managing all of this let me show you  <start>  99.74 - 105.259 : what I mean so if you open vs code and  <start>  102.11 - 108.7 : you go over here to the extensions and  <start>  105.259 - 112.219 : you type in docker it\\'s gonna be the  <start>  108.7 - 115.009 : first pick okay it\\'s by Microsoft it\\'s  <start>  112.219 - 118.03899999999999 : like 3.6 million downloads you can miss  <start>  115.009 - 119.39 : it download this extension first after  <start>  118.039 - 122.39 : doing that you\\'ll see this little docker  <start>  119.39 - 124.909 : image over here to the left click that  <start>  122.39 - 127.28 : in voila you have everything you need  <start>  124.909 - 129.47 : here you can see all of your running or  <start>  127.28 - 131.81 : stopped containers you can see all of  <start>  129.47 - 134.0 : your images you can see registries  <start>  131.81 - 137.209 : volumes all of that good stuff right  <start>  134.0 - 138.98 : here in BS code so for me that\\'s super  <start>  137.209 - 141.44 : valuable but let me show you some other  <start>  138.98 - 143.69 : things that make this just absolutely  <start>  141.44 - 145.28 : wonderful so let me close that all right  <start>  143.69 - 148.37 : so I\\'ve created just a really basic  <start>  145.28 - 152.06 : Express j/s app right so here\\'s index  <start>  148.37 - 154.28 : dot HTML and I\\'m using tailwind the CSS  <start>  152.06 - 156.31900000000002 : I\\'m just using I\\'m just displaying one  <start>  154.28 - 158.87 : of their little built-in cards on the  <start>  156.319 - 161.54 : page that\\'s all this app is here\\'s the  <start>  158.87 - 163.489 : server j/s I\\'m on port 8081  <start>  161.54 - 165.5 : and here\\'s the docker file and the  <start>  163.489 - 167.66 : docker file is very very basic I\\'m just  <start>  165.5 - 169.609 : grabbing the node image I\\'m creating the  <start>  167.66 - 172.72899999999998 : work directory I\\'m copying my package  <start>  169.609 - 173.21 : JSON there I\\'m doing an NPM install to  <start>  172.729 - 176.60000000000002 : install  <start>  173.21 - 179.12 : modules and I\\'m copying my app files I\\'m  <start>  176.6 - 181.34 : exposing the port 8081 and I\\'m running  <start>  179.12 - 184.01 : the command node server yes  <start>  181.34 - 186.8 : that\\'s all this docker file does and it  <start>  184.01 - 188.26999999999998 : builds my image now how do you do that  <start>  186.8 - 189.8 : well you got to go to the doctor  <start>  188.27 - 191.60000000000002 : documentation you got to look up docker  <start>  189.8 - 193.73000000000002 : build and find out all the little  <start>  191.6 - 195.14 : commands but with vias code it\\'s much  <start>  193.73 - 197.35999999999999 : much easier let me show you how easy  <start>  195.14 - 198.95 : this is to build this image so if you  <start>  197.36 - 201.32000000000002 : open your pallet which on the Mac is  <start>  198.95 - 202.91 : shift command P you\\'re gonna type in  <start>  201.32 - 204.89 : docker now that you have the extension  <start>  202.91 - 208.25 : and you\\'re gonna see this docker images  <start>  204.89 - 209.89999999999998 : build image click on that then it asked  <start>  208.25 - 213.11 : you to tag the image so I\\'m just gonna  <start>  209.9 - 214.61 : leave it Express docker colon latest I\\'m  <start>  213.11 - 217.16000000000003 : gonna hit enter and it\\'s gonna start  <start>  214.61 - 219.23000000000002 : building my image and I\\'ll check this  <start>  217.16 - 222.41 : out alright so I\\'ve already pre built it  <start>  219.23 - 224.84 : so it\\'s it\\'s all cached there so here\\'s  <start>  222.41 - 226.67 : my step 1 through 7 it built  <start>  224.84 - 228.41 : successfully if you come up here you\\'ll  <start>  226.67 - 230.80999999999997 : see the command they use docker build  <start>  228.41 - 232.60999999999999 : here\\'s a couple of flags docker file and  <start>  230.81 - 235.4 : then it tags it with the tag we gave it  <start>  232.61 - 237.05 : and current directory so say you wanted  <start>  235.4 - 238.61 : to tweak something in that it\\'s as  <start>  237.05 - 240.20000000000002 : simple as just coming down here hitting  <start>  238.61 - 241.46 : the UP button and then changing whatever  <start>  240.2 - 243.70999999999998 : you need but I don\\'t need to change  <start>  241.46 - 245.78 : anything vs code building successfully  <start>  243.71 - 248.92000000000002 : now if I come over here and I look under  <start>  245.78 - 251.66 : images I should now have this Express  <start>  248.92 - 254.23999999999998 : docker image and there it is Express  <start>  251.66 - 256.7 : docker if I open that it says here\\'s the  <start>  254.24 - 258.71000000000004 : tag it\\'s the latest from a few seconds  <start>  256.7 - 261.02 : ago if i refresh that it\\'s like 6  <start>  258.71 - 262.90999999999997 : minutes ago because I built it I think  <start>  261.02 - 264.34999999999997 : before I started doing this video and it  <start>  262.91 - 266.81 : hasn\\'t changed since then so it still  <start>  264.35 - 268.61 : has that image so now I need to build  <start>  266.81 - 270.62 : this image how do I run it how do I spin  <start>  268.61 - 272.36 : up this container well you need to go  <start>  270.62 - 275.09000000000003 : back to the docker documentation and  <start>  272.36 - 277.1 : look up docker run but if you got vs  <start>  275.09 - 278.57 : code you don\\'t have to check this out I  <start>  277.1 - 281.09000000000003 : just bring up that little command  <start>  278.57 - 284.3 : palette again and I type in docker and  <start>  281.09 - 287.33 : I\\'m gonna look for docker images run  <start>  284.3 - 289.28000000000003 : look at this here\\'s the command docker  <start>  287.33 - 291.68 : images run I want to select what I want  <start>  289.28 - 293.86999999999995 : to run and I want to run Express docker  <start>  291.68 - 297.65000000000003 : let me click that I want to run the  <start>  293.87 - 299.54 : latest and here it is docker run as soon  <start>  297.65 - 301.45 : as I do that up here under containers  <start>  299.54 - 304.16 : I\\'m gonna see that now I have a running  <start>  301.45 - 306.12899999999996 : container Express docker is now running  <start>  304.16 - 307.47900000000004 : you\\'ll see here the command  <start>  306.129 - 310.749 : they used to run that if you need to  <start>  307.479 - 313.449 : tweak it and so now air containers  <start>  310.749 - 314.11 : running how do I now pull that up in a  <start>  313.449 - 316.839 : web page  <start>  314.11 - 319.029 : well my port is 80 81 so obviously I  <start>  316.839 - 320.499 : could do a localhost:8080 one but it\\'s  <start>  319.029 - 323.919 : much easier just to go to the container  <start>  320.499 - 329.589 : right click go to open and browser and  <start>  323.919 - 332.679 : watch this boom there\\'s my app right  <start>  329.589 - 335.61899999999997 : there so I built the image  <start>  332.679 - 337.839 : I ran the image and I opened it up in my  <start>  335.619 - 340.65900000000005 : browser all from the yes code without  <start>  337.839 - 343.33 : having to touch the command line so  <start>  340.659 - 344.949 : let\\'s say hey well as soon as this is  <start>  343.33 - 347.919 : done I need to tweak some files inside  <start>  344.949 - 349.779 : of the container how do you do that well  <start>  347.919 - 352.44899999999996 : you got to look up the docker exec  <start>  349.779 - 355.719 : command but you don\\'t need to again we  <start>  352.449 - 359.949 : got vs code come here to vs code you can  <start>  355.719 - 364.11899999999997 : right click and go to attach shell click  <start>  359.949 - 367.089 : that just gonna run this and if you\\'re  <start>  364.119 - 370.809 : on a PC it actually errors out but if  <start>  367.089 - 373.179 : you erase all of this to this point and  <start>  370.809 - 375.519 : just type in bash instead of all of that  <start>  373.179 - 378.63899999999995 : it runs but right here I\\'m inside the  <start>  375.519 - 381.309 : app so I can hit LS LS a to see  <start>  378.639 - 384.099 : everything and I see I have my files  <start>  381.309 - 386.319 : here I can go back one and there\\'s my  <start>  384.099 - 388.269 : app directory that I built see that app  <start>  386.319 - 390.55 : so if I need to jump in here and tweak  <start>  388.269 - 392.499 : any files I can tweak it so that\\'s  <start>  390.55 - 393.849 : really all I wanted to show you today if  <start>  392.499 - 394.92900000000003 : you\\'re having trouble at docker you  <start>  393.849 - 398.529 : having trouble wrapping your head around  <start>  394.929 - 401.10999999999996 : it try doing everything from vs code  <start>  398.529 - 403.659 : from this docker extension you got your  <start>  401.11 - 406.539 : containers you have your images for me I  <start>  403.659 - 408.129 : use it daily I love this option I can  <start>  406.539 - 410.409 : see all of my images and I can do what I  <start>  408.129 - 413.019 : need to do if I pull something from  <start>  410.409 - 414.339 : docker hub it\\'s right here I can go and  <start>  413.019 - 415.599 : do what I need to do so I hope that  <start>  414.339 - 417.729 : helps you a little bit if you\\'re a  <start>  415.599 - 419.43899999999996 : docker newbie if you\\'re dr. expert and  <start>  417.729 -

90.79899999999999 : and any other files you might have had  <start>  88.96 - 93.52 : in images and you can select all of them  <start>  90.799 - 93.52000000000001 : and say okay  <start>  93.84 - 98.0 : and it does the first commit and push to  <start>  96.159 - 100.159 : our github account  <start>  98.0 - 102.0 : and it successfully put that in there  <start>  100.159 - 103.119 : you won\\'t have a dash 2 on yours that\\'s  <start>  102.0 - 104.32 : fine  <start>  103.119 -

118.799 : account which is what this will do and  <start>  116.88 - 120.15899999999999 : we can then see  <start>  118.799 - 122.96000000000001 : that that  <start>  120.159 - 125.04 : came on to our repository again yours  <start>  122.96 - 126.64 : won\\'t have a dash too but you should see  <start>  125.04 - 129.36 : your um  <start>  126.64 - 131.28 : about me folder inside that folder you  <start>  129.36 - 134.0 : should see your index  <start>  131.28 -

154.64000000000001 : then our  <start>  151.92 - 157.51899999999998 : our remote repository once we save that  <start>  154.64 - 159.83999999999997 : our remote or our control source will  <start>  157.519 - 162.31900000000002 : get a little number that says oh you\\'ve  <start>  159.84 - 164.31900000000002 : made a change you\\'ve added a file you\\'ve  <start>  162.319 - 165.92 : added a paragraph you\\'ve done something  <start>  164.319 - 167.44 : to your project it will start keeping  <start>  165.92 - 168.55999999999997 : track of every time there\\'s a change  <start>  167.44 - 170.16 : there  <start>  168.56 - 171.519 : and what you\\'ll have to do from this  <start>  170.16 - 173.68 : point on  <start>  171.519 - 176.16 : then is just say i\\'m happy with these  <start>  173.68 - 178.72 : changes which is a commit  <start>  176.16 - 180.239 : to our repository  <start>  178.72 - 181.68 : and you can if there\\'s a whole bunch of  <start>  180.239 - 183.519 : changes you can add them all with the  <start>  181.68 - 186.08 : changes line plus or you can add  <start>  183.519 - 187.36 : individually with the pluses next to  <start>  186.08 - 189.36 : each file  <start>  187.36 - 191.12 : so i\\'ll just always hit this plus next  <start>  189.36 - 193.12 : to changes  <start>  191.12 - 195.68 : and i\\'ll say give it a meaningful  <start>  193.12 - 195.68 : message  <start>  196.08 - 200.8 : what you had just done what changes  <start>  198.48 - 203.76 : you\\'ve made and then you can commit that  <start>  200.8 - 205.92000000000002 : to your local get on your computer which  <start>  203.76 - 208.07999999999998 : is keeping track of that project  <start>  205.92 - 209.04 : but to actually push it out to github  <start>  208.08 - 211.59900000000002 : now  <start>  209.04 - 215.04 : we can click on the  <start>  211.599 - 217.35999999999999 : three dots here and push it out  <start>  215.04 - 218.48 : and it will then go ahead and make those  <start>  217.36 - 221.20000000000002 : changes  <start>  218.48 - 224.07999999999998 : and back on our github account we can  <start>  221.2 - 225.67999999999998 : actually see those changes  <start>  224.08 - 228.239 : if i go into that you\\'ll have one  <start>  225.68 - 230.239 : repository i have a lot  <start>  228.239 - 233.92000000000002 : and we can actually see  <start>  230.239 - 235.84 : the changes here that were made i never  <start>  233.92 - 236.79899999999998 : edit in this editor  <start>  235.84 - 239.04 : um  <start>  236.799 - 240.31900000000002 : i would only i would not ever use it  <start>  239.04 - 242.79899999999998 : actually i\\'m just showing you that we  <start>  240.319 - 245.2 : added those changes always edit inside  <start>  242.799 - 247.68 : the visual studio code but you\\'ll see  <start>  245.2 - 251.11999999999998 : that now your changes are getting pushed  <start>  247.68 - 255.04000000000002 : to a remote location  <start>  251.12 -

10.96 : this is the URL so let\\'s try to search  <start>  9.28 - 13.079999999999998 : for another repository and I\\'ll show you  <start>  10.96 - 15.32 : how you can do this for any repository  <start>  13.08 - 19.64 : so let\\'s say  <start>  15.32 - 21.16 : GitHub some repository so let\\'s see any  <start>  19.64 - 24.48 : project that we have  <start>  21.16 - 27.96 : here okay let\\'s see some trending  <start>  24.48 - 32.16 : repositories okay so I think let\\'s try  <start>  27.96 - 34.52 : to do something uh that is is a bit  <start>  32.16 - 37.16 : smaller  <start>  34.52 - 39.399 : okay I don\\'t know what this is this is  <start>  37.16 -

49.480000000000004 : this now I\\'m opening this because I want  <start>  47.32 - 53.0 : to show you the URL see so this is the  <start>  49.48 - 54.64 : URL format that is github.com first and  <start>  53.0 - 57.84 : then the username and then the project  <start>  54.64 - 60.92 : name this is the pro URL for any GitHub  <start>  57.84 - 62.68000000000001 : project but this one it is instance St  <start>  60.92 - 65.4 : is the username and this is the project  <start>  62.68 - 69.6 : so what we can do is we can just copy  <start>  65.4 - 71.96000000000001 : this right or what you can do is you can  <start>  69.6 - 76.32 : just click on code here and copy  <start>  71.96 - 78.88 : this so this is the same thing this here  <start>  76.32 - 81.39999999999999 : and this is the same thing but we just  <start>  78.88 - 83.32 : add do G to the end and they are  <start>  81.4 - 86.0 : basically the same so what we need to do  <start>  83.32 - 90.96 : is after you\\'ve copy the URL right so  <start>  86.0 - 92.32 : I\\'ll copy this for now and you go to  <start>  90.96 - 94.32 : wherever you want to make your project  <start>  92.32 - 96.439 : right so I\\'ll click on Python and what I  <start>  94.32 - 99.67999999999999 : want to do is I want the project to be  <start>  96.439 - 102.96 : created here so uh if I\\'m cloning I want  <start>  99.68 - 105.88000000000001 : that project to be made here like this  <start>  102.96 - 108.399 : my project right so I want that project  <start>  105.88 - 110.15899999999999 : folder inside this python so what you  <start>  108.399 - 113.92 : need to do is you need to open Visual  <start>  110.159 - 116.52000000000001 : Studio code in this directory and how  <start>  113.92 - 117.92 : you can do that is just hold shift and  <start>  116.52 - 122.92 : right  <start>  117.92 - 125.84 : click and you can click open in  <start>  122.92 - 128.72 : terminal and then here just type code  <start>  125.84 -

196.56 : or the 64-bit version  <start>  194.0 - 199.2 : for me 62-bit if you have 32-bit version  <start>  196.56 - 201.92000000000002 : then you can download it using this so  <start>  199.2 - 204.07999999999998 : if you don\\'t know uh whether it\\'s 64-bit  <start>  201.92 - 206.39999999999998 : or 32-bit what you can do is just search  <start>  204.08 - 208.48000000000002 : it up this pc and you can just  <start>  206.4 - 210.159 : right-click and properties  <start>  208.48 -

224.239 : operating system if it\\'s 32 for you then  <start>  221.12 - 227.12 : download the 32-bit version for it okay  <start>  224.239 - 230.48000000000002 : so i will go with 64 bit  <start>  227.12 - 230.48000000000002 : okay cool let\\'s download it  <start>  230.959 - 238.159 : and see it\\'s already downloaded and we  <start>  233.68 - 239.43900000000002 : can just install it with one click  <start>  238.159 - 242.79899999999998 : okay so  <start>  239.439 - 245.68 : so here it is the main setup  <start>  242.799 - 247.76000000000002 : here it says that uh  <start>  245.68 - 249.84 : number one proceed with the installation  <start>  247.76 -

261.51899999999995 : enter it  <start>  259.199 - 263.44 : does something and like  <start>  261.519 - 265.04 : rust is successfully  <start>  263.44 - 267.36 : installed great  <start>  265.04 - 269.52000000000004 : and you can just press enter key to  <start>  267.36 - 271.28000000000003 : continue  <start>  269.52 - 273.59999999999997 : yeah that\\'s it we have successfully  <start>  271.28 - 275.67999999999995 : installed rust but you know for me it  <start>  273.6 - 278.16 : took like really less time it took  <start>  275.68 - 281.04 : around like one or two seconds because i  <start>  278.16 - 283.44 : already had like rust installed it just  <start>  281.04 - 286.88 : updated it if there was any update for  <start>  283.44 - 289.44 : you it\\'s gonna take a bit longer like  <start>  286.88 - 292.0 : i don\\'t know but it\\'s gonna take some  <start>  289.44 - 293.84 : bit more time so be patient  <start>  292.0 - 297.12 : and that\\'s it we have successfully  <start>  293.84 - 298.96 : installed rust up now we can get  <start>  297.12 - 302.16 : get to the main coding part the stuff  <start>  298.96 - 304.71999999999997 : with the visual studio code okay so  <start>  302.16 - 306.88000000000005 : let\\'s open visual studio code first okay  <start>  304.72 - 308.96000000000004 : so i made this folder where i\\'m gonna  <start>  306.88 - 312.71999999999997 : show you everything in this video so  <start>  308.96 - 312.71999999999997 : let\\'s open with code  <start>  313.68 - 318.639 : and so after it\\'s open  <start>  316.8 - 323.8 : you need to go to the  <start>  318.639 - 323.8 : extension part and like search for rust  <start>  324.4 - 328.63899999999995 : and you need to click on the rust  <start>  326.08 - 331.19899999999996 : analyzer thing not the first one it\\'s  <start>  328.639 - 333.12 : not in use no longer so  <start>  331.199 - 334.96000000000004 : click on the second one and you can  <start>  333.12 - 337.28000000000003 : install it from here there will be a  <start>  334.96 - 339.84 : install option for me it\\'s already  <start>  337.28 - 343.19899999999996 : installed and that\\'s it you can be you  <start>  339.84 - 344.63899999999995 : know easily coding now in rust in visual  <start>  343.199 - 347.28000000000003 : studio code  <start>  344.639 - 350.639 : so let\\'s you know make uh make the  <start>  347.28 - 353.28 : project uh let\\'s make the workspace  <start>  350.639 - 357.039 : let\\'s uh type in  <start>  353.28 - 360.55999999999995 : cargo new and the workspace name let\\'s  <start>  357.039 - 364.31899999999996 : name it yt underscore project  <start>  360.56 - 367.28000000000003 : and yeah that\\'s it let\\'s hit enter  <start>  364.319 - 369.759 : yeah so it says that created a new  <start>  367.28 - 373.28 : uh package called yt projects  <start>  369.759 - 375.759 : and that\\'s it now you can see there\\'s a  <start>  373.28 - 378.79999999999995 : folder called yt project there\\'s another  <start>  375.759 - 382.56 : folder called src with getting ignore a  <start>  378.8 - 385.199 : main rust file and a cargo dot  <start>  382.56 - 386.0 : or like to ml whatever you want to call  <start>  385.199 - 387.12 : it  <start>  386.0 - 389.039 : and  <start>  387.12 - 391.52 : yeah and you can see that after it\\'s  <start>  389.039 - 394.4 : open all the extensions are getting  <start>  391.52 - 396.08 : activated so you need to wait for it  <start>  394.4 - 397.59999999999997 : for me it\\'s going to take a bit longer  <start>  396.08 - 400.96 : because you know my  <start>  397.6 - 403.6 : laptop is kind of slow uh so for you it  <start>  400.96 - 405.44 : it might be a bit faster so after  <start>  403.6 - 408.319 : everything is like set up then you can  <start>  405.44 - 409.759 : you know start coding with it so here is  <start>  408.319 - 412.24 : like the main  <start>  409.759 - 413.91900000000004 : rs file the main rust file where you can  <start>  412.24 - 416.96000000000004 : see our default  <start>  413.919 - 419.28 : function is already created and you can  <start>  416.96 - 421.12 : see there is print uh the hello world  <start>  419.28 - 423.75899999999996 : thing we can just change it and you know  <start>  421.12 - 425.44 : let\\'s say a  <start>  423.759 - 427.36 : high  <start>  425.44 - 430.56 : high yt  <start>  427.36 - 431.44 : okay so let\\'s save it and let\\'s  <start>  430.56 - 434.8 : run  <start>  431.44 - 439.28 : run it but the rust analyzer isn\\'t ready  <start>  434.8 - 439.28000000000003 : till now let\\'s wait for it to get ready  <start>  445.68 - 449.759 : and you can see like there are many  <start>  447.759 - 452.16 : other files here like  <start>  449.759 - 453.12 : the the cargo lock then like the get  <start>  452.16 - 454.88000000000005 : ignore  <start>  453.12 - 456.56 : like there\\'s a main  <start>  454.88 - 458.8 : mean rs file  <start>  456.56 - 460.56 : and you can see there\\'s a run  <start>  458.8 - 462.24 : run slash uh  <start>  460.56 - 464.319 : debug button you can just click on it  <start>  462.24 - 467.199 : and it\\'s gonna run mineral that\\'s it  <start>  464.319 - 469.28000000000003 : that\\'s as easy as that  <start>  467.199 - 473.199 : so you can see it\\'s it\\'s loading  <start>  469.28 - 474.63899999999995 : finished running yeah high yt  <start>  473.199 - 477.039 : that\\'s it  <start>  474.639 - 479.28000000000003 : that\\'s it for this video uh thanks for  <start>  477.039 - 480.8 : watching and whatever i said will be  <start>  479.28 - 482.08 : similar for  <start>  480.8 - 484.08 : uh you know for  <start>  482.08 - 486.639 : linux and mac  <start>  484.08 - 488.31899999999996 : i believe so the the installation is  <start>  486.639 - 490.16 : gonna be a bit different you you need to  <start>  488.319 - 493.44 : just install the  <start>  490.16 - 494.8 : this uh you just need to install the  <start>  493.44 - 497.68 : rust up  <start>  494.8 - 500.479 : app using this thing the the command  <start>  497.68 - 503.759 : and in your terminal and the rest of the  <start>  500.479 - 505.44 : things will be like similar okay so so  <start>  503.759 - 506.47900000000004 : that\\'s it for this video thanks for  <start>  505.44 - 511.08 : watching  <start>  506.479 - 511.08 : see you guys in the next one bye <start>\"\\n',\n",

11.759 : help you work better with your  <start>  8.48 - 14.639 : programming uh and productivity tool and  <start>  11.759 - 17.72 : it will also help you with uh make it  <start>  14.639 - 19.4 : make your vs code experience very much  <start>  17.72 - 20.759999999999998 : more productive okay there are so many  <start>  19.4 - 23.32 : helpful extensions we\\'re going to look  <start>  20.76 - 24.880000000000003 : at this amazing extensions of 2024 so  <start>  23.32 - 27.64 : these are the ones we are going to run  <start>  24.88 - 30.679 : through uh the first one is tab n code  <start>  27.64 - 33.079 : Runner live server draw.io preer  <start>  30.679 - 35.32 : code spell checker Excel viewer to-do  <start>  33.079 - 35.32 : and  <start>  35.96 - 42.0 : material so let\\'s head over to our uh  <start>  39.68 - 44.16 : Visual Studio code we I have opened the  <start>  42.0 - 46.719 : simple JavaScript folder okay we got  <start>  44.16 - 49.07899999999999 : some code over here so let\\'s look at the  <start>  46.719 - 50.399 : first extension which is tab n so go to  <start>  49.079 - 54.6 : the extensions  <start>  50.399 - 54.6 : tab uh and search for tab  <start>  55.239 - 60.919999999999995 : n okay at the top you see this uh dab 9  <start>  58.64 - 62.6 : a auto complete and chat for JavaScript  <start>  60.92 - 64.839 : python typescript go Java and more so  <start>  62.6 - 66.64 : this are like what this basically does  <start>  64.839 - 68.28 : it\\'s a brilliant AI coding assistant  <start>  66.64 - 69.84 : with AI code completion so this helps  <start>  68.28 - 71.119 : you like you know if you\\'re a beginner  <start>  69.84 - 72.4 : or even an experience like if you want  <start>  71.119 - 74.759 : to write faster code you know your  <start>  72.4 - 76.36 : syntax to avoid syntax errors it will do  <start>  74.759 - 79.96 : some auto complete for you which is  <start>  76.36 - 82.079 : absolutely great so let\\'s take a look  <start>  79.96 - 85.72 : let\\'s first install  <start>  82.079 - 88.0 : it so it\\'s going to take you to this  <start>  85.72 - 91.84 : uh page which will say like you know  <start>  88.0 - 91.84 : describes what it is about  <start>  92.759 - 97.399 : so it\\'s going to take some time so I  <start>  94.439 - 100.03999999999999 : will just move ahead and in this video  <start>  97.399 - 102.43900000000001 : to where the tab 9 is already  <start>  100.04 - 104.68 : installed okay so it\\'s getting installed  <start>  102.439 - 104.67999999999999 : over  <start>  107.079 - 111.75899999999999 : here so you got to accept some uh  <start>  109.799 - 115.04 : settings you can also change it I\\'m  <start>  111.759 - 115.04 : going to accept all settings for  <start>  117.68 - 122.92 : now and I think it\\'s pretty much it\\'s  <start>  120.24 - 125.52 : still initializing  <start>  122.92 - 128.879 : it all right so now let\\'s take a look at  <start>  125.52 - 131.239 : this uh extension all right you will see  <start>  128.879 - 132.51999999999998 : the tab n it says Get U code to get the  <start>  131.239 - 134.239 : code suggestion as you code you will see  <start>  132.52 - 138.36 : the tab n code suggestions in line in  <start>  134.239 - 140.31900000000002 : Gray in addition to the IDS popup  <start>  138.36 - 141.48000000000002 : suggestions all right so let\\'s take a  <start>  140.319 - 143.92 : look  <start>  141.48 - 147.79999999999998 : here so we got to sign in okay we also  <start>  143.92 - 147.79999999999998 : have to do a sign so let\\'s do  <start>  148.76 - 153.39999999999998 : that  <start>  151.08 - 155.59900000000002 : so you got to go to this  <start>  153.4 - 158.08 : website so what I\\'m going to do here is  <start>  155.599 - 160.23899999999998 : I\\'m going to log in with my Google  <start>  158.08 - 162.72 : account which is first easier you can  <start>  160.239 - 162.72 : also give a  <start>  162.879 - 166.67999999999998 : email so we\\'re going to select my login  <start>  165.4 - 170.31900000000002 : over here and we\\'re going to proceed  <start>  166.68 - 173.72 : into tab 9 it\\'s going to ask me for some  <start>  170.319 - 173.72 : password please go  <start>  178.76 - 182.67999999999998 : ahead so now it tells me that you can  <start>  181.2 - 184.35999999999999 : close this tab and start working with  <start>  182.68 - 187.28 : this ID all right so awesome okay so  <start>  184.36 - 190.87900000000002 : let\\'s close this tab let\\'s go back to  <start>  187.28 - 190.879 : our this thing and let\\'s open up the  <start>  205.12 - 211.68 : code all right so here now let me try to  <start>  208.12 - 211.68 : write one script  <start>  211.72 - 214.35999999999999 : so here if you  <start>  216.84 - 222.239 : see this automatically gives me the next  <start>  220.2 - 223.28 : suggestion okay you can either choose to  <start>  222.239 - 227.64000000000001 : accept  <start>  223.28 - 230.519 : it so now if I want to write like some  <start>  227.64 - 234.48 : logic other logic over  <start>  230.519 - 234.48000000000002 : here like if I go out of  <start>  238.68 - 241.68 : this  <start>  243.4 - 247.28 : now I can also use it to explain a  <start>  245.2 - 250.2 : section of my code suppose I go here and  <start>  247.28 - 252.12 : select I I select say explain code so  <start>  250.2 - 254.39999999999998 : like if I go here it gives me the  <start>  252.12 - 255.84 : options as to what all I can do I  <start>  254.4 - 258.84000000000003 : selected the explain code option I  <start>  255.84 - 261.28000000000003 : selected this block so let me see I\\'m  <start>  258.84 - 261.28 : going to click  <start>  268.6 - 273.8 : continue  <start>  271.6 - 276.36 : initially it takes some time to  <start>  273.8 - 277.639 : work so here it goes ahead and explains  <start>  276.36 - 279.40000000000003 : to me like you know what that code is  <start>  277.639 - 280.84000000000003 : doing which is really awesome okay and  <start>  279.4 - 283.71999999999997 : it also gives  <start>  280.84 - 285.11999999999995 : you the full details as to what  <start>  283.72 - 287.40000000000003 : functions it is doing and what else it  <start>  285.12 - 289.8 : is doing okay so we have this thing over  <start>  287.4 - 294.0 : here which is I feel really helpful for  <start>  289.8 - 294.0 : us so it will also explain your  <start>  296.28 - 300.28 : code and now we can also say generate  <start>  298.72 - 301.759 : test or we can write you know doc  <start>  300.28 - 304.4 : strings for code or you can also fix  <start>  301.759 - 307.08000000000004 : code now let\\'s say suppose we have a  <start>  304.4 - 309.96 : error over here okay we not we have a  <start>  307.08 - 312.8 : syntax error over here now when we try  <start>  309.96 - 314.84 : to save this it\\'s going to give an error  <start>  312.8 - 316.68 : so if I cover this part of the code and  <start>  314.84 - 320.08 : say fix  <start>  316.68 - 322.24 : code it takes some  <start>  320.08 - 327.12 : time so it\\'s telling me a couple of  <start>  322.24 - 327.12 : Errors over here so it gives me the  <start>  327.4 - 331.479 : example of how to fix this  <start>  332.56 - 337.0 : so which is already great I can just fix  <start>  335.24 - 339.28000000000003 : it from here or I can just say insert  <start>  337.0 - 341.84 : and it replaces the whole thing all  <start>  339.28 - 343.59999999999997 : right so you can make a judgment call  <start>  341.84 - 345.88 : over here but what I\\'m saying over here  <start>  343.6 - 348.16 : is this is applicable for Java Python  <start>  345.88 - 351.28 : and it\\'s extremely helpful so this is  <start>  348.16 - 353.8 : one of my top tools uh which I suggest  <start>  351.28 - 355.71999999999997 : especially in the world of AI now and  <start>  353.8 - 357.96000000000004 : this is one of the best extensions that  <start>  355.72 - 360.56 : is tab 9 which gives you AI suggestions  <start>  357.96 - 362.35999999999996 : for your code  <start>  360.56 - 365.199 : all  <start>  362.36 - 367.759 : right next one the next extension we\\'ll  <start>  365.199 - 370.759 : look at code  <start>  367.759 - 370.759 : Runner <start>\"\\n',\n",
